UPGRADE FROM 0.12 to 0.13
=========================

Agent
-----

 * `Toolbox\AgentProcessor` has been removed. Tool calling is no longer wired as an input/output processor pair;
   the `Agent` drives the tool-calling loop itself. Pass the toolbox and its settings to the `Agent` instead:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, includeSources: true, maxToolCalls: 75);
   -$agent = new Agent($platform, $model, [$processor], [$processor]);
   +$agent = new Agent($platform, $model, toolbox: $toolbox, maxToolCalls: 75, includeSources: true);
   ```

   The `excludeToolMessages`, `includeSources`, `maxToolCalls` and `eventDispatcher` settings moved from the
   processor to the `Agent` constructor unchanged. Which tool calls get executed is now delegated to the new
   `Toolbox\ToolExecutorInterface` (default: `SequentialToolExecutor`), so a custom execution strategy can be
   plugged in via the `toolExecutor` argument.

 * `AgentInterface::call()` now returns a lazy `Execution` instead of a `ResultInterface`. The execution *is* the
   result it produces, so reading it eagerly is unchanged — `$agent->call($input)->getContent()` still works — but
   the returned object is now also iterable and observable:

   ```php
   // eager, unchanged
   $text = $agent->call('Hello')->getContent();

   // observe the run, or resolve the result explicitly
   foreach ($agent->call('Hello') as $update) { /* Progress / Result updates */ }
   $result = $agent->call('Hello')->onProgress($cb)->getResult();
   ```

   Custom `AgentInterface` implementations and decorators must change their `call()` return type to `Execution`
   and wrap their result:

   ```php
   public function call(string|MessageBag|UserMessage $input, array $options = []): Execution
   {
       return new Execution(function (): \Generator {
           yield new Result($someResult);
       });
   }
   ```

   Two consequences of the laziness: the agent no longer runs until the execution is consumed — side effects and
   exceptions now surface on `getContent()`/`getResult()`/iteration rather than on the `call()` line — and code that
   type-checks the result (`$agent->call(...) instanceof TextResult`) must `getResult()` first. Because the loop is
   also no longer recursing through `call()`, output processors see the final, fully assembled result and input
   processors run once per agent call instead of once per tool-calling round.

 * `Toolbox\StreamListener` has been removed, and `call()` with the `stream` option no longer returns a
   `StreamResult`. Iterating the returned execution's `getContent()` still yields the platform's deltas, so the
   common streaming loop is unchanged:

   ```php
   $result = $agent->call($messages, ['stream' => true]);
   foreach ($result->getContent() as $delta) { /* ... */ } // unchanged

   // or observe the whole execution
   foreach ($agent->call($messages, ['stream' => true]) as $update) { /* ... */ }
   ```

   Code relying on the `StreamResult` type specifically — `instanceof StreamResult`, `addListener()` — must be
   reworked to consume the execution instead (as the `Chat` component's `stream()` now does).

AI Bundle
---------

 * The `keep_tool_messages` agent option has been renamed to `exclude_tool_messages` to match the
   `excludeToolMessages` argument of the `Agent` it configures. The option name was inverted
   against its behavior since that argument was flipped in 0.4, so `keep_tool_messages: true`
   was in fact *excluding* tool messages from the conversation history. Rename the option to keep the
   current behavior:

   ```diff
    # config/packages/ai.yaml
    ai:
        agent:
            my_agent:
   -            keep_tool_messages: true
   +            exclude_tool_messages: true
   ```

   The default (`false`, tool messages are preserved) is unchanged.

Chat
----

 * `ChatStreamListener` has been removed. `Chat::stream()` now consumes the agent's execution itself: it yields the
   streamed deltas and persists the assistant message, including the result metadata, once the stream is complete.
   Since `AgentInterface::call()` no longer returns a `StreamResult` (see the Agent section), there is no stream to
   attach the listener to anymore.

MCP Bundle
----------

 * The bundle now supports several MCP servers per application, so every server-related option moved
   under a named entry in `mcp.servers`. **Capabilities are no longer exposed automatically**: each
   server declares what it exposes, and `['*']` is the explicit "everything of that kind" — that is the
   1:1 migration of the previous behavior:

   ```diff
    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
   -    app: 'my-app'
   -    version: '1.0.0'
   -    description: 'My MCP server'
   -    instructions: 'Use this server for time calculations.'
   -    pagination_limit: 50
   -    client_transports:
   -        stdio: true
   -        http: true
   -    http:
   -        path: /_mcp
   -        allowed_hosts: ['example.com']
   -        session:
   -            store: cache
   -    apps:
   -        enabled: true
   +    servers:
   +        default:
   +            name: 'my-app'
   +            version: '1.0.0'
   +            description: 'My MCP server'
   +            instructions: 'Use this server for time calculations.'
   +            pagination_limit: 50
   +            transports:
   +                stdio: true
   +                http: true
   +            http:
   +                path: /_mcp
   +                allowed_hosts: ['example.com']
   +            session:
   +                store: cache
   +            registry: '*'
   ```

   Option by option: `app` became `servers.<name>.name` (defaulting to the configuration key),
   `client_transports` became `servers.<name>.transports` (its `http` option now defaults to `true`),
   `http.session` moved up to `servers.<name>.session` (it was never HTTP-specific — a STDIO server
   uses it too), and `apps.enabled` was replaced by the `servers.<name>.registry.apps` list
   (`enabled: false` → omit it, the auto/`true` modes → `apps: ['*']`).

   `http.path` now defaults to `/mcp/<name>` instead of `/_mcp`. The default is always derived from the
   server name, so that adding a second server can never move an existing endpoint; set `http.path`
   explicitly to keep the old URL.

   The required `registry:` option decides what a server exposes. Give it one list to cover every kind
   of capability, or a map to narrow each kind separately. Entries match a service id, a class name, or
   a namespace prefix (written with a trailing backslash):

   ```yaml
   mcp:
       servers:
           public:
               http: { path: /mcp }
               registry:
                   tools: ['App\Mcp\Public\']
                   resources: ['*']
           editors:
               http: { path: /mcp/editors }
               registry: '*'
           reporting:
               http: { path: /mcp/reporting }
               registry: ['App\Mcp\Reporting\']   # every kind, from one namespace
   ```

   A pattern that matches no service *at all* on its server is a compile-time error — practically
   always a typo. Matching only some kinds is fine, which is what makes the single-list form usable:
   few applications carry all five kinds under one namespace. The reverse is allowed on purpose too —
   a service carrying an MCP attribute that no server lists is simply not exposed, and `debug:mcp`
   reports those under "Not exposed by any server".

 * The per-server services replace their singleton counterparts: `mcp.registry`, `mcp.server.builder`,
   `mcp.server`, `mcp.session.store`, `mcp.middleware_factory` and `mcp.server.controller` became
   `mcp.server.<name>.registry`, `mcp.server.<name>.builder`, `mcp.server.<name>`,
   `mcp.server.<name>.session.store`, `mcp.server.<name>.middleware_factory` and
   `mcp.server.<name>.controller`. Autowire a specific server with `Mcp\Server $<name>Server`.

   Session storage is now isolated per server by default (`%kernel.cache_dir%/mcp-sessions/<name>` and
   the `mcp-<name>-` cache prefix), and two servers resolving to the same storage is rejected at compile
   time: session ids are not namespaced by server, so a shared store would let a session created on a
   public server be accepted by a firewalled one.

 * The route name `_mcp_endpoint` became `_mcp_endpoint_<name>`. The `config/routes.yaml` entry
   (`resource: .`, `type: mcp`) is unchanged.

 * `mcp:server` gained an optional server argument (`bin/console mcp:server editors`), required as soon
   as more than one server enables the STDIO transport — one process can serve only one of them.
   `debug:mcp` gained a `--server` option to restrict its output to a single server.

 * A configured MCP client is autowired under its own name, not under `<name>Client`. Rename the
   argument to match:

   ```diff
    public function __construct(
   -    private McpClientInterface $researchClient,
   +    private McpClientInterface $research,
    ) {
    }
   ```

   The same alias backs `#[Target('research')]`, which is the form the bundle's documentation shows and
   the one to use when the argument is named for its role rather than for the client:

   ```php
   public function __construct(
       #[Target('research')] private McpClientInterface $client,
   ) {
   }
   ```

   A single configured client also answers a plain `McpClientInterface` type hint, unchanged.

Mate
----

 * Skills are now copied into `.agents/skills/mate-<name>/` instead of being symlinked into
   `vendor/`, and `.claude/skills/` mirrors them with relative symlinks. Both folders are generated
   output that `mate skills:install` rebuilds from source on every run, so stop editing them by hand
   — to own a skill's content, set `'mode' => 'override'` for it in `mate/extensions.php` and edit
   your copy under `mate/skills/<name>/` instead. Because they are now plain copies rather than
   symlinks into `vendor/`, committing them is safe and recommended: an upstream skill change then
   shows up as a reviewable diff. Mate does not add them to your `.gitignore`.

 * All per-skill state now lives in `mate/extensions.php`. `enabled` and `mode`
   (`managed` or `override`) are yours to edit; `state`, `source`, `source_hash`, `hash` and
   `targets` are written by `mate skills:install` and rewritten on every run. If you ran a `0.13`
   development build, delete the now-unused `mate/skills.lock.php` — it is neither read nor written
   anymore.

 * Mate no longer runs an MCP server; it is now a plain CLI that coding agents invoke directly.
   The `mcp/sdk` dependency, the `serve`/`stop` commands and the whole MCP server runtime have
   been removed. Remove any `mate serve`/`mate stop` usage and delete the generated `mcp.json`
   and `.mcp.json` from your project — agents should run the `mate` commands instead.

 * `mate init` no longer generates `mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` or the Codex wrappers (`bin/codex`,
   `bin/codex.bat`). It now writes CLI-oriented agent instructions (`mate/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   and the managed block in `AGENTS.md`). Point your coding agent at those instructions instead
   of an MCP server configuration.

 * The tool/resource commands were renamed:

   ```diff
   -vendor/bin/mate mcp:tools:list
   -vendor/bin/mate mcp:tools:inspect <tool>
   -vendor/bin/mate mcp:tools:call <tool> '{"limit": 1}'
   -vendor/bin/mate mcp:resources:read <uri>
   +vendor/bin/mate tools:list
   +vendor/bin/mate tools:inspect <tool>
   +vendor/bin/mate tools:call <tool> --limit=1
   +vendor/bin/mate resources:read <uri>
   ```

   `tools:call` now takes tool parameters as long options instead of a positional JSON object.
   Use `--<param>=<value>` (booleans may be passed as a bare `--<flag>`), or pass a full JSON
   object via `--json='{...}'` for complex/array-valued parameters.

 * Custom tools, resources and resource templates now use native Mate attributes instead of the
   `mcp/sdk` ones. Replace the attribute imports on your `mate/src/` classes:

   ```diff
   -use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpTool;
   -use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpResource;
   -use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpResourceTemplate;
   +use Symfony\AI\Mate\Attribute\MateTool;
   +use Symfony\AI\Mate\Attribute\MateResource;
   +use Symfony\AI\Mate\Attribute\MateResourceTemplate;

   -#[McpTool(name: 'my-tool', description: '...')]
   +#[MateTool(name: 'my-tool', description: '...')]
    public function myTool(int $limit = 10): string { /* ... */ }
   ```

   The parameters are otherwise the same (`name`, `title`, `description` for tools;
   `uri`/`uriTemplate`, `name`, `title`, `description`, `mimeType` for resources), and input
   schemas are still derived from the method signature plus `@param` PHPDoc. Two differences to
   watch for:

   * `name` is **required** on `#[MateTool]`; it no longer defaults to the method name.
   * The attributes may only be placed on a **method**, no longer on a class.

   Getting either wrong makes the attribute fail to construct, and discovery then skips the whole
   file with only a log line, so the tools simply stop appearing in `tools:list`. Run
   `vendor/bin/mate tools:list` after migrating to confirm everything is still there.

 * Prompts are gone. There is no Mate equivalent of `#[McpPrompt]`, `debug:capabilities` no
   longer accepts `--type=prompt` and no longer reports a prompt count. Move the content of a
   prompt method into a skill (`mate skills:install`) or into your project's `AGENTS.md`.

 * `symfony-services` no longer returns the bare `id => class` map. It now answers with the map
   under `services`, plus `count` and `truncated`, and lists at most `limit` entries (default 100)
   so an unfiltered call cannot fill the context window. Together with the `untrusted_data`
   envelope that all tool responses gained, a script reading the old shape needs two extra hops:

   ```diff
   -$services = json_decode($output, true);
   +$services = json_decode($output, true)['untrusted_data']['services'];
   ```

   In a multi-kernel application the result stays nested per context, so each context carries its
   own `services`, `count` and `truncated`:
   `json_decode($output, true)['untrusted_data']['admin']['services']`.

   The tool also fails now, instead of answering with an empty result, when no container has been
   dumped yet. That case used to be indistinguishable from "no service matched"; warm the cache
   (`bin/console cache:warmup`) in the environment you are inspecting.

 * An unknown `--format` value is rejected instead of falling back to the human-readable default.
   A script passing anything other than the formats a command lists now gets an error and a
   non-zero exit code rather than a table it cannot parse.

 * `mate/config.php` gained two parameters, and `mate init` fills them in for new projects.
   `mate.invocation` is the command your coding agent must use (for example
   `ddev exec vendor/bin/mate`); it is written into `mate/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and the managed
   `AGENTS.md` block, so the wrapper reaches the agent that has to type it. `mate.php_version`
   records the runtime, and Mate refuses to start under a different major.minor, because it would
   otherwise report on a runtime that is not your application's. `init`, `list`, `help` and
   `completion` print a warning instead of refusing.

   **An existing project gets neither parameter, and therefore neither behavior.** `discover` does
   not add them, `mate.invocation` stays the bare `vendor/bin/mate` and the interpreter check stays
   off. Add both by hand; do not re-run `vendor/bin/mate init` for this, because accepting its
   overwrite prompt replaces `mate/config.php` with the template and drops any services you
   registered in it:

   ```diff
    // mate/config.php
    $container->parameters()
   +    // The command your coding agent must use, wrapper included.
   +    ->set('mate.invocation', 'ddev exec vendor/bin/mate')
   +
   +    // The major.minor your application runs on. Leave it out to keep Mate runnable under any
   +    // interpreter, which is what an upgraded project does until you set it.
   +    ->set('mate.php_version', '8.3')
    ;
   ```

   This matters most where the application does not run on the host: under DDEV, Docker or the
   Symfony CLI, an unpinned Mate started on the host reads the host's runtime and reports on
   something that is not the application under test.

Platform
--------

 * The Gemini and VertexAI bridges now yield a single `ToolCallComplete` delta at the end of a stream,
   carrying all function calls of the response, instead of one `ToolCallComplete` per streamed
   `functionCall` part. Consumers collecting tool calls across several deltas can rely on the single
   batch instead:

   ```diff
   -$toolCalls = [];
    foreach ($result->asStream() as $delta) {
        if ($delta instanceof ToolCallComplete) {
   -        $toolCalls = array_merge($toolCalls, $delta->getToolCalls());
   +        $toolCalls = $delta->getToolCalls();
        }
    }
   ```

   Multi-candidate responses (`candidateCount` > 1) are the exception and keep their previous shape: their
   deltas are wrapped in a `ChoiceDelta`, carrying one `ToolCallComplete` per function call, without
   `ToolCallStart` and without a terminal batch. A consumer walking `ChoiceDelta::getDeltas()` still has to
   merge those.

 * `Result\Stream\ListenerInterface` gained an `onError()` method, dispatched with the new
   `Result\Stream\ErrorEvent`. Listeners not extending
   `AbstractStreamListener` must add the method:

   ```diff
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\ErrorEvent;

    final class MyStreamListener implements ListenerInterface
    {
        public function onComplete(CompleteEvent $event): void
        {
            // ...
        }
   +
   +    public function onError(ErrorEvent $event): void
   +    {
   +        // ...
   +    }
    }
   ```

UPGRADE FROM 0.11 to 0.12
=========================

Agent
-----

 * `AgentInterface::call()` now accepts a `string` or a single `UserMessage` next to a `MessageBag`, and its
   first parameter has been renamed from `$messages` to `$input`. Calls with a `MessageBag` keep working
   unchanged, but custom implementations of `AgentInterface` have to widen their signature:

   ```diff
   -public function call(MessageBag $messages, array $options = []): ResultInterface
   +public function call(string|MessageBag|UserMessage $input, array $options = []): ResultInterface
    {
   +    $messages = InputNormalizer::toMessageBag($input);
        // ...
    }
   ```

   `TraceableAgent::getCalls()` reports the untouched input under the `input` key instead of `messages`:

   ```diff
   -$call['messages'];
   +$call['input'];
   ```

MCP Bundle
----------

 * MCP elements (tools, prompts, resources, resource templates) are now registered from the service
   container at compile time instead of the SDK's runtime file-based discovery, and the `mcp.discovery`
   configuration has been removed:

   ```diff
    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        app: 'app'
   -    discovery:
   -        scan_dirs: ['src/Mcp']
   -        exclude_dirs: []
   ```

   In a default Symfony application no further change is needed: any service carrying an MCP attribute
   (`#[McpTool]`, `#[McpPrompt]`, `#[McpResource]`, `#[McpResourceTemplate]`) is picked up through
   autoconfiguration. Classes that were previously discovered by scanning the filesystem but are not
   registered as services (e.g. excluded in `services.yaml` or shipped in `vendor/`) must now be
   registered as services — or registered through a custom `Mcp\Capability\Registry\Loader\LoaderInterface`
   implementation (autoconfigured with the `mcp.loader` tag).

 * The `Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Profiler\TraceableRegistry` class has been removed. The profiler data
   collector now builds the MCP server itself to read the registry, so the panel shows the full
   capability set on every request. The collector (and the `mcp` profiler panel) is only registered
   when at least one `client_transports` option is enabled.

Platform
--------

 * `ModelRouterInterface::resolve()` now returns a `ModelRouter\RoutingDecision` instead of a
   `ProviderInterface`, and accepts a `Model` instance next to a model name. This lets a router
   select the model itself (based on the input, a rule set, or cost) instead of only dispatching a
   pre-decided model to a provider. Custom routers must wrap their provider in a `RoutingDecision`:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\ProviderInterface;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Model;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\ModelRouter\RoutingDecision;

    final class MyModelRouter implements ModelRouterInterface
    {
   -    public function resolve(string $model, iterable $providers, array|string|object $input, array $options = []): ProviderInterface
   +    public function resolve(string|Model $model, iterable $providers, array|string|object $input, array $options = []): RoutingDecision
        {
   -        return $this->pickProvider($model, $providers);
   +        return new RoutingDecision($this->pickProvider($model, $providers));
        }
    }
   ```

   Passing a model or options to the `RoutingDecision` constructor replaces the requested model or
   options for that invocation; leaving them out keeps the requested values. Calling
   `Platform::invoke()` is unchanged.

   As a consequence, `Model` instances passed to `Platform::invoke()` are no longer resolved on a
   separate path: they now go through the `ModelRoutingEvent` and the model router like model names
   do. Listeners of `ModelRoutingEvent` therefore have to expect `getModel()` to return either a
   `non-empty-string` or a `Model`.

 * A provider without a `ModelClient` registered for the invoked model now throws
   `Exception\ModelNotFoundException` instead of `Exception\RuntimeException`, so that a routing
   decision naming a provider that cannot serve the model fails the same way as an unknown model
   name. Both implement `Exception\ExceptionInterface`, but note that `ModelNotFoundException`
   extends `\InvalidArgumentException`, not `\RuntimeException`.

 * The Albert bridge now follows the same `base_url` convention as the Generic bridge:
   the API version must **not** be included in `baseUrl`, it is part of the path instead.
   Remove the version segment from your configured URL:

   ```diff
   -Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Albert\Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, 'https://albert.api.etalab.gouv.fr/v1');
   +Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Albert\Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, 'https://albert.api.etalab.gouv.fr');
   ```

   This also applies to `Albert\ApiClient`, which now appends `/v1/models` (instead of `/models`)
   to the configured URL when listing models.

UPGRADE FROM 0.10 to 0.11
=========================

Agent
-----

 * Rename of `getMetadata()` of tool call events to `getDefinition()` affecting
   `ToolCallRequested`, `ToolCallArgumentsResolved`, `ToolCallSucceeded` and `ToolCallFailed`.
   Update custom listeners:

   ```diff
   -$event->getMetadata()->getName();
   +$event->getDefinition()->getName();
   ```

Platform
--------

 * The OpenAI `DallE` bridge has been renamed to `Image`, since OpenAI retired the DALL-E models in
   favor of the `gpt-image-*` family (which the renamed bridge serves). Update namespace imports:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\DallE;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Image;
   ```

   The `dall-e-2` and `dall-e-3` catalog entries have been removed because the models no longer exist
   on OpenAI's API. Use a `gpt-image-*` model instead; these return base64-encoded images only (the
   `response_format` option is no longer supported).

   The bridge-specific `ImageResult`, `Base64Image`, and `UrlImage` classes have been removed in favor
   of the generic result types used by the other multi-modal bridges: a single image is now a
   `Result\BinaryResult`, and multiple images (`n` > 1) a `Result\MultiPartResult` of `BinaryResult`s.

   ```diff
   -$result = $platform->invoke('dall-e-3', $prompt, ['response_format' => 'url'])->getResult();
   -$url = $result->getContent()[0]->url;
   +$result = $platform->invoke('gpt-image-1', $prompt)->getResult();
   +$result->asFile('image.png'); // Result\BinaryResult
   ```

 * `ToolCallMessage` now holds `Content\ContentInterface` parts instead of a single string, mirroring
   `UserMessage`. Its constructor takes a variadic `ContentInterface ...$content`, `getContent()` returns
   `Content\ContentInterface[]`, and a new `asText()` returns the flattened text. Wrap plain strings in
   `Content\Text` when instantiating the class directly:

   ```diff
   -new ToolCallMessage($toolCall, 'result');
   +new ToolCallMessage($toolCall, new Text('result'));
   ```

   `Message::ofToolCall()` keeps accepting strings and upcasts them to `Content\Text`, so call sites using
   the factory are unaffected. To read the textual result, use `asText()` instead of `getContent()`:

   ```diff
   -$message->getContent();
   +$message->asText();
   ```

 * `Capability::INPUT_MULTIPLE` has been removed from all embedding models in the model catalogs (it is
   kept on reranking models). Every embedding bridge already accepts multiple inputs in a single API
   call, so the capability no longer carried meaning for embeddings. Code that branched on
   `$model->supports(Capability::INPUT_MULTIPLE)` for an embedding model will now receive `false`; pass
   the full array of texts to `Platform::invoke()` directly instead — the bridge handles batching.

 * Base URLs are now normalized across all bridges: a trailing slash on a configured base URL is
   tolerated and no longer produces a double slash in request URLs.

 * The Azure bridge now accepts a full base URL *with* scheme and no longer rejects it. A bare host
   keeps working (the `https` scheme is assumed when none is given), so existing configurations are
   unaffected, but you can now point it at an `http://` gateway:

   ```diff
   -// previously a scheme was rejected
   -Factory::createPlatform('my-resource.openai.azure.com', ...);
   +Factory::createPlatform('https://my-resource.openai.azure.com', ...); // also still: 'my-resource.openai.azure.com'
   ```

 * The `$hostUrl` argument of the Decart and Docker Model Runner factories and clients has been
   renamed to `$baseUrl` for consistency with the other bridges. Positional usage is unaffected;
   update named arguments:

   ```diff
   -Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Decart\Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, hostUrl: 'https://api.decart.ai/v1');
   +Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Decart\Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, baseUrl: 'https://api.decart.ai/v1');
   ```

 * The Albert factory no longer throws when the base URL ends with a trailing slash; the slash is
   stripped instead.

 * The VertexAI bridge now derives the API host from the configured `location` instead of always
   using `aiplatform.googleapis.com`. `null` and `global` keep the existing global host, but a
   regional location (e.g. `europe-west1`) now targets `europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com`,
   and the data-residency values `eu`/`us` target `aiplatform.eu.rep.googleapis.com` /
   `aiplatform.us.rep.googleapis.com`. Requests that previously reached the global endpoint while
   configured with a regional location will now hit the regional endpoint. If you relied on the
   global host for a regional location, pass `global` (or `null`) explicitly:

   ```diff
   -Factory::createPlatform('europe-west1', 'my-project'); // used aiplatform.googleapis.com
   +Factory::createPlatform('global', 'my-project'); // keep the global host
   ```

   The same applies to the AI Bundle, which passes its configured `location` to the factory:

   ```diff
   ai:
       platform:
           vertexai:
   -            location: 'europe-west1' # used aiplatform.googleapis.com
   +            location: 'global' # keep the global host
               project_id: 'my-project'
   ```

   A `location` that is neither `global`, `eu`/`us`, nor a region (e.g. `europe-west1`) is now
   rejected with an `InvalidArgumentException` instead of being sent to a non-existing host.

Store
-----

 * The `StoreInterface::clear()` method was added to the interface. It removes all documents from the store,
   while keeping the underlying table, index or collection intact - in contrast to `ManagedStoreInterface::drop()`,
   which removes the infrastructure itself. Custom stores need to implement the new method:

   ```php
   public function clear(array $options = []): void;

   // Usage
   $store->clear();
   ```

 * The Manticore Search `Store` now creates its `uuid` column as a `STRING` attribute instead of a `TEXT` field,
   because removing documents by id is not supported on stored text fields and failed with a server error.
   Existing tables need to be recreated (`drop()` + `setup()`) for `remove()` to work.

 * The `endpointUrl` and `apiKey` parameter for Typesense `Store` has been removed, use `StoreFactory` instead
 * The `accountId`, `apiKey`, and `endpointUrl` parameter for Cloudflare `Store` has been removed, use `StoreFactory` instead
 * The `endpoint` parameter for SurrealDB `Store` has been removed, use `StoreFactory` instead

 * Endpoint URLs are now normalized across all HTTP store bridges: a trailing slash is tolerated, and
   path-prefixed endpoints behind a reverse proxy keep their prefix.

 * The endpoint constructor argument has been renamed to `$endpoint` for consistency across bridges.
   Positional usage is unaffected; update named arguments:

   ```diff
   -new Symfony\AI\Store\Bridge\Supabase\Store($httpClient, url: $url, ...);
   +new Symfony\AI\Store\Bridge\Supabase\Store($httpClient, endpoint: $url, ...);
   ```

   | Bridge          | Old argument   | New argument |
   | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
   | ManticoreSearch | `$host`        | `$endpoint`  |
   | Milvus          | `$endpointUrl` | `$endpoint`  |
   | Supabase        | `$url`         | `$endpoint`  |
   | SurrealDb       | `$endpointUrl` | `$endpoint`  |

 * Postgres Store now uses quoted identifiers for table and column names, so they are case-sensitive. If you relied on
   implicit lowercasing of unquoted identifiers, adopt them so they match the case of your table and column names.

UPGRADE FROM 0.9 to 0.10
========================

Agent
-----

 * `SystemPromptInputProcessor` and `MemoryInputProcessor` now modify the message bag in place
   instead of replacing it with a clone, so injected system messages and messages appended during
   the agent run (e.g. tool calls) end up in the caller's bag. To keep your bag untouched:

   ```diff
   -$agent->call($messages);
   +$agent->call(clone $messages);
   ```

   Alternatively, if you do want to keep the appended messages in your bag (e.g. for conversation
   history) but need to render or re-send only the conversational messages, strip the tool-call
   messages and tool-call-only assistant messages with the new `MessageBag::withoutToolMessages()`:

   ```diff
   -$messages->withoutSystemMessage()->getMessages();
   +$messages->withoutSystemMessage()->withoutToolMessages()->getMessages();
   ```

 * The `maxToolCalls` parameter of `AgentProcessor` now defaults to `50` instead of `null`. The tool-calling
   loop is therefore bounded out of the box and throws a `MaxIterationsExceededException` once the limit is
   reached. If you relied on the previous unbounded behaviour, pass `null` explicitly:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox);
   +$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, maxToolCalls: null);
   ```

   To raise or lower the cap instead, pass the desired value:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox);
   +$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, maxToolCalls: 75);
   ```

AI Bundle
---------

 * Agent tools are now opt-in. Previously, when an agent did not configure the `tools` option, all
   services tagged with `ai.tool` (e.g. classes using the `#[AsTool]` attribute) were injected into
   the agent's toolbox. Now an agent without the `tools` option (or with `tools` set to `null` or an
   empty list) gets no toolbox at all. To keep the previous behavior, enable tools explicitly:

   ```diff
    ai:
        agent:
            my_agent:
                model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
   +            tools: true
   ```

   Configuring an explicit list of tools, or `tools: false`, keeps working unchanged. Additionally,
   enabling `prompt.include_tools` for an agent without configured tools now throws an exception.

 * Tool-calling agents are now bounded by default. Following the `AgentProcessor` change above, an
   agent's tool-calling loop is capped at `50` iterations and throws a `MaxIterationsExceededException`
   once exceeded. Configure the cap per agent via the new `max_tool_calls` option, or set it to `null`
   to restore the previous unbounded behaviour:

   ```diff
    ai:
        agent:
            my_agent:
                model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
   +            max_tool_calls: null # or any integer to adjust the cap
   ```

Platform
--------

 * The models.dev bridge `Factory` and `BridgeResolver` classes were removed. Build providers with
   the regular bridge factories, passing a models.dev `ModelCatalog` (which now carries the model
   class the target bridge expects), and resolve base URLs with `ProviderRegistry`.

   For a provider with a specialized bridge:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ModelsDev\Factory;
   -
   -$platform = Factory::createPlatform('anthropic', $_ENV['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY']);
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Anthropic\Factory as AnthropicFactory;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ModelsDev\ModelCatalog;
   +
   +$platform = AnthropicFactory::createPlatform(
   +    apiKey: $_ENV['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'],
   +    modelCatalog: new ModelCatalog('anthropic'),
   +);
   ```

   For an OpenAI-compatible provider:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ModelsDev\Factory;
   -
   -$platform = Factory::createPlatform('deepseek', $_ENV['DEEPSEEK_API_KEY']);
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Generic\Factory as GenericFactory;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ModelsDev\ModelCatalog;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ModelsDev\ProviderRegistry;
   +
   +$registry = new ProviderRegistry();
   +$platform = GenericFactory::createPlatform(
   +    baseUrl: $registry->getApiBaseUrl('deepseek'),
   +    apiKey: $_ENV['DEEPSEEK_API_KEY'],
   +    modelCatalog: new ModelCatalog('deepseek'),
   +);
   ```

 * The models.dev bridge `ModelResolver` class was removed. To route across multiple providers,
   compose them into a `Platform` and rely on its default router (`CatalogBasedModelRouter`), which
   picks the first provider in array order whose catalog owns the model; order the providers to
   disambiguate model ids exposed by more than one of them.

 * `PlatformInterface::invoke()` now accepts `string|Model` for its first argument, and
   `ProviderInterface::invoke()` and `ProviderInterface::supports()` were widened the same way. Custom
   implementations and decorators must widen their signatures accordingly:

   ```diff
   -public function invoke(string $model, array|string|object $input, array $options = []): DeferredResult
   +public function invoke(string|Model $model, array|string|object $input, array $options = []): DeferredResult

   -public function supports(string $model): bool
   +public function supports(string|Model $model): bool
   ```

 * The Anthropic, Generic, OpenAI, OpenResponses, Cerebras, DeepSeek, Mistral, Cohere, Gemini,
   Perplexity, Scaleway, and VertexAI bridges now throw `ExceedContextSizeException` when a 400
   response reports a context overflow (previously `BadRequestException`, or a generic
   `RuntimeException` for the Scaleway and VertexAI bridges). As `ExceedContextSizeException` does
   not extend `BadRequestException`, catch it explicitly:

   ```diff
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Exception\ExceedContextSizeException;

    try {
        $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages)->getResult();
   +} catch (ExceedContextSizeException $e) {
   +    // shrink the conversation and retry
    } catch (BadRequestException $e) {
        // ...
    }
   ```

Store
-----

 * The `ClickHouse`, `Redis`, `SurrealDb`, and `InMemory` store implementations are now `final`.
   Extending them is no longer possible; compose or decorate `StoreInterface` instead.

UPGRADE FROM 0.8 to 0.9
=======================

Chat
----

 * `MessageNormalizer` now emits an ordered `parts` field for `AssistantMessage` to preserve the sequence
   of `Text`, `Thinking`, and `ToolCall` blocks. Payloads stored under the previous format (only `content`
   and `toolsCalls`) still denormalize, but the ordering between text and tool calls is not reconstructed.
   Re-normalize stored chat history to upgrade it to the new format.

Mate
----

 * The default user namespace scaffolded by `mate init` changed from `App\Mate\` to `Mate\`.
   Existing projects must update their `composer.json` autoload entry and move user-defined
   tool classes into the new namespace:

   ```diff
    {
        "autoload-dev": {
            "psr-4": {
   -            "App\\Mate\\": "mate/src/"
   +            "Mate\\": "mate/src/"
            }
        }
    }
   ```

   ```diff
   -namespace App\Mate;
   +namespace Mate;
   ```

   After updating, run `composer dump-autoload`.

Platform
--------

 * The OpenAI Responses bridges return `MultiPartResult` instead of `ChoiceResult` for multi-item output. Iterate parts instead of treating them as alternative completions:

   ```diff
   -if ($result instanceof ChoiceResult) {
   -    foreach ($result->getContent() as $alternative) { /* ... */ }
   -}
   +if ($result instanceof MultiPartResult) {
   +    foreach ($result as $part) { /* ... */ }
   +}
   ```

 * Reasoning summaries from OpenAI Responses bridges are exposed as one `ThinkingResult` per `summary_text` chunk instead of being folded into a `TextResult`:

   ```diff
   -$part instanceof TextResult ? $part->getContent() : null
   +$part instanceof ThinkingResult ? $part->getContent() : null
   ```

 * `AssistantMessage` takes a variadic list of `ContentInterface` parts instead of separate
   `content`/`toolCalls`/`thinkingContent`/`thinkingSignature` arguments. New content classes:
   `Message\Content\Thinking`, `Message\Content\ExecutableCode`, `Message\Content\CodeExecution`.
   `Result\ToolCall` now implements `ContentInterface` and can be passed directly:

   ```diff
   -new AssistantMessage(
   -    content: 'Hello',
   -    toolCalls: [new ToolCall('id1', 'fn', ['a' => 1])],
   -    thinkingContent: 'reasoning',
   -    thinkingSignature: 'sig',
   -);
   +new AssistantMessage(
   +    new Thinking('reasoning', 'sig'),
   +    new Text('Hello'),
   +    new ToolCall('id1', 'fn', ['a' => 1]),
   +);
   ```

   `getContent()` returns `ContentInterface[]`; use `asText()` for the concatenated text.
   `getToolCalls()` returns `ToolCall[]` (no longer `?array`). `getThinking()` returns `Thinking[]` and
   replaces `hasThinkingContent()`/`getThinkingContent()`/`getThinkingSignature()`.

 * `Message::ofAssistant()` is variadic and accepts `string`, `ContentInterface`, or `ResultInterface`
   arguments — `TextResult`/`ThinkingResult`/`ToolCallResult`/`ExecutableCodeResult`/`CodeExecutionResult`
   map to their content equivalents and `MultiPartResult` is unwrapped recursively. Result types without
   a known mapping (e.g. `BinaryResult`, `ObjectResult`) throw `InvalidArgumentException` so unhandled
   cases surface; stringify them in the caller before passing them in:

   ```diff
   -Message::ofAssistant($objectResult);
   +Message::ofAssistant($objectResult->getContent()->toString());
   ```

 * Anthropic `ResultConverter` returns a `ThinkingResult` (or a `MultiPartResult` containing one) for
   responses with `thinking` blocks. A thinking-only response previously raised `RuntimeException`. Update
   any `try`/`catch` and any code that assumed the converter only returned `TextResult` or `ToolCallResult`.

Store
-----

 * Add support for `ScopingHttpClient` in Meilisearch `Store`
 * The `endpointUrl` parameter for Meilisearch `Store` has been removed
 * The `apiKey` parameter for Meilisearch `Store` has been removed
 * A `StoreFactory` has been introduced for Meilisearch `Store`
 * The Meilisearch `Store` no longer reads `$options['q']` in `query()`. Use `HybridQuery` to combine vector and full-text search:

   ```diff
   -$store->query(new VectorQuery($embedding), ['q' => 'keyword', 'semanticRatio' => 0.5]);
   +$store->query(new HybridQuery($embedding, 'keyword', 0.5));
   ```

 * Factory methods `fromPdo` and `fromDbal` for `Symfony\AI\Store\Bridge\Postgres\Store` moved to
   `Symfony\AI\Store\Bridge\Postgres\StoreFactory`:

   ```diff
   -Store::fromPdo($pdo, $tableName, $vectorFieldName, $distance);
   +StoreFactory::createStoreFromPdo($pdo, $tableName, $vectorFieldName, $distance, $lang);
   -Store::fromDbal($connection, $tableName, $vectorFieldName, $distance);
   +StoreFactory::createStoreFromDbal($connection, $tableName, $vectorFieldName, $distance, $lang);
   ```

UPGRADE FROM 0.7 to 0.8
=======================

Agent
-----

 * The `SimilaritySearch::$usedDocuments` property is no longer public. Use `getUsedDocuments()` instead:

   ```diff
   -$usedDocuments = $similaritySearch->usedDocuments;
   +$usedDocuments = $similaritySearch->getUsedDocuments();
   ```

 * The `public array $calls` property of `TraceableAgent` and `TraceableToolbox` has been changed to `private`. Use the new `getCalls()` method instead:

   ```diff
   -$traceableAgent->calls;
   +$traceableAgent->getCalls();

   -$traceableToolbox->calls;
   +$traceableToolbox->getCalls();
   ```

 * The constructors of `StaticMemoryProvider` and `ToolCallsExecuted` no longer accept variadic parameters. Pass an array instead:

   ```diff
   -new StaticMemoryProvider('fact1', 'fact2');
   +new StaticMemoryProvider(['fact1', 'fact2']);

   -new StaticMemoryProvider('fact1');
   +new StaticMemoryProvider(['fact1']);

   -new ToolCallsExecuted($toolResult1, $toolResult2);
   +new ToolCallsExecuted([$toolResult1, $toolResult2]);

   -new ToolCallsExecuted($toolResult1);
   +new ToolCallsExecuted([$toolResult1]);
   ```

AI Bundle
---------

 * The service ID `ai.agent.response_format_factory` has been renamed to `ai.platform.response_format_factory`:

   ```diff
   -$container->get('ai.agent.response_format_factory');
   +$container->get('ai.platform.response_format_factory');
   ```

Chat
----

 * The `public array $calls` property of `TraceableChat` and `TraceableMessageStore` has been changed to `private`. Use the new `getCalls()` method instead:

   ```diff
   -$traceableChat->calls;
   +$traceableChat->getCalls();

   -$traceableMessageStore->calls;
   +$traceableMessageStore->getCalls();
   ```

Platform
--------

 * The `#[With]` attribute has been renamed to `#[Schema]`. The `WithAttributeDescriber` class has been renamed to
   `SchemaAttributeDescriber` and the related service id `ai.platform.json_schema.describer.with_attribute` to
   `ai.platform.json_schema.describer.schema_attribute`.

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Contract\JsonSchema\Attribute\With;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Contract\JsonSchema\Attribute\Schema;

   -#[With(minimum: 0, maximum: 10)]
   +#[Schema(minimum: 0, maximum: 10)]
    int $number,
   ```

 * The `ImageResult::$revisedPrompt` property is no longer public. Use `getRevisedPrompt()` instead:

   ```diff
   -$revisedPrompt = $imageResult->revisedPrompt;
   +$revisedPrompt = $imageResult->getRevisedPrompt();
   ```

 * The `public array $calls` property and `public \WeakMap $resultCache` property of `TraceablePlatform` have been changed to `private`. Use the new `getCalls()` and `getResultCache()` methods instead:

   ```diff
   -$traceablePlatform->calls;
   +$traceablePlatform->getCalls();

   -$traceablePlatform->resultCache;
   +$traceablePlatform->getResultCache();
   ```

 * Bridge factories are now unified as a single `Factory` class per bridge (replacing `PlatformFactory`), with explicit
   `createProvider()` and `createPlatform()` methods. `createPlatform()` returns a ready-to-use `Platform` for the
   standalone case (most common). `createProvider()` returns a `ProviderInterface` for composing multiple providers
   into one `Platform` (multi-provider auto-routing, load balancing, failover). Update your imports and method calls:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\PlatformFactory;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory;

   -$platform = PlatformFactory::create(apiKey: 'sk-...');
   +$platform = Factory::createPlatform(apiKey: 'sk-...');
   ```

   The same rename applies to every bridge. Multi-provider composition is now straightforward:

   ```php
   use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Anthropic\Factory as AnthropicFactory;
   use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory as OpenAiFactory;
   use Symfony\AI\Platform\Platform;

   $platform = new Platform([
       OpenAiFactory::createProvider(apiKey: 'sk-...'),
       AnthropicFactory::createProvider(apiKey: 'sk-...'),
   ]);

   $platform->invoke('gpt-4o', $messages);             // → OpenAI
   $platform->invoke('claude-3-5-sonnet', $messages);  // → Anthropic
   ```

   `Platform` is now a router over one or more `ProviderInterface` instances. Its constructor signature changed to
   `(array $providers, ?ModelRouterInterface $modelRouter, ?EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher)`. Model
   invocations dispatch a new `ModelRoutingEvent` before resolution, allowing listeners to modify the model name,
   input, options, or short-circuit routing by setting a provider directly via `$event->setProvider(...)`.

 * The constructors of `VectorResult`, `ToolCallResult`, `RerankingResult`, `ToolCallComplete`, and `ImageResult`
   (OpenAI DallE bridge) no longer accept variadic parameters. Pass an array instead:

   ```diff
   -new VectorResult($vector1, $vector2);
   +new VectorResult([$vector1, $vector2]);

   -new ToolCallResult($toolCall1, $toolCall2);
   +new ToolCallResult([$toolCall1, $toolCall2]);

   -new RerankingResult($entry1, $entry2);
   +new RerankingResult([$entry1, $entry2]);

   -new ToolCallComplete($toolCall1, $toolCall2);
   +new ToolCallComplete([$toolCall1, $toolCall2]);

   -new ImageResult(null, $image1, $image2);
   +new ImageResult(null, [$image1, $image2]);
   ```

 * Properties of all HuggingFace Output classes have been changed from public to private readonly. Use getter methods instead:

   ```diff
   -$classification->label;
   -$classification->score;
   +$classification->getLabel();
   +$classification->getScore();
   ```

   Affected classes: `Classification`, `ClassificationResult`, `DetectedObject`, `FillMaskResult`,
   `ImageSegment`, `ImageSegmentationResult`, `MaskFill`, `ObjectDetectionResult`,
   `QuestionAnsweringResult`, `SentenceSimilarityResult`, `TableQuestionAnsweringResult`,
   `Token`, `TokenClassificationResult`, `ZeroShotClassificationResult`.

 * The `Contract::create()` factory method and all bridge-specific `Contract::create()` methods no longer
   accept variadic `NormalizerInterface` arguments. Pass an array instead:

   ```diff
   -Contract::create(new MyNormalizer(), new AnotherNormalizer());
   +Contract::create([new MyNormalizer(), new AnotherNormalizer()]);

   -AnthropicContract::create(new MyNormalizer());
   +AnthropicContract::create([new MyNormalizer()]);
   ```

   This affects the following classes: `Contract`, `AnthropicContract`, `CartesiaContract`,
   `ClaudeCodeContract`, `CodexContract`, `DecartContract`, `ElevenLabsContract`,
   `GeminiContract` (Gemini and VertexAi bridges), `HuggingFaceContract`, `OllamaContract`,
   `OpenAiContract`, `OpenResponsesContract`, `PerplexityContract`, `VoyageContract`.

Store
-----

 * The `public array $calls` property of `TraceableStore` has been changed to `private`. Use the new `getCalls()` method instead:

   ```diff
   -$traceableStore->calls;
   +$traceableStore->getCalls();
   ```

UPGRADE FROM 0.6 to 0.7
=======================

Agent
-----

 * The `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\ToolFactory\AbstractToolFactory` class has been removed. If you extended it to create
   a custom tool factory, implement `ToolFactoryInterface` yourself and use `Symfony\AI\Platform\Contract\JsonSchema\Factory`
   directly if needed.
 * The `ToolFactoryInterface::getTool()` method signature has changed to accept `object|string` instead of `string`:

   ```diff
   -public function getTool(string $reference): iterable;
   +public function getTool(object|string $reference): iterable;
   ```

 * The `SimilaritySearch` tool now requires a `RetrieverInterface` instead of `VectorizerInterface` and `StoreInterface`:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Store\Document\VectorizerInterface;
   -use Symfony\AI\Store\StoreInterface;
   +use Symfony\AI\Store\Retriever;

   -$similaritySearch = new SimilaritySearch($vectorizer, $store);
   +$retriever = new Retriever($store, $vectorizer);
   +$similaritySearch = new SimilaritySearch($retriever);
   ```

 * The `SimilaritySearch` tool now accepts an optional `$promptTemplate` parameter to customize the result header (default: `'Found documents with the following information:'`)
 * `Toolbox\StreamListener::onChunk()` has been renamed to `onDelta()`.
   The listener now checks `$delta instanceof TextDelta` instead of
   `is_string($chunk)` to accumulate the assistant text buffer.
 * The `StreamListener` now reacts to `ToolCallComplete` instead of
   `ToolCallResult`. If you have a custom `StreamListener` or check for
   `ToolCallResult` in stream consumers, update to `ToolCallComplete`.

AI Bundle
---------

 * The traceable profiler decorators have been moved to their respective components. Update your imports if you
   reference them directly:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceablePlatform;
   +use Symfony\AI\Platform\TraceablePlatform;

   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceableAgent;
   +use Symfony\AI\Agent\TraceableAgent;

   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceableToolbox;
   +use Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\TraceableToolbox;

   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceableStore;
   +use Symfony\AI\Store\TraceableStore;

   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceableChat;
   +use Symfony\AI\Chat\TraceableChat;

   -use Symfony\AI\AiBundle\Profiler\TraceableMessageStore;
   +use Symfony\AI\Chat\TraceableMessageStore;
   ```

 * The `api_catalog` option for `Ollama` has been removed as the catalog is now automatically fetched from the Ollama server
 * The `api_key` option for `Ollama` is now `null` by default to allow the usage of a `ScopingHttpClient`
 * The `endpoint` option for `Ollama` is now `null` by default to allow the usage of a `ScopingHttpClient`
 * The `strategy` option for `Cache` store is now `cosine` by default
 * The `DistanceCalculator` is no longer a service when using `Cache` store

Chat
----

 * The `ChatInterface` now has a `stream()` method. If you implement this interface,
   you need to add this method to your implementation.

Mate
----

 * Run `vendor/bin/mate discover` to update the generated `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file with the latest
   tool descriptions and agent instructions.

Platform
--------

 * `ModelCatalog` in `Ollama` has been replaced by `OllamaApiCatalog`
 * `OllamaApiCatalog` in `Ollama` has been renamed to `ModelCatalog`
 * `Ollama` model is now `final`
 * `ModelCatalog` in `ElevenLabs` has been replaced by `ElevenLabsApiCatalog`
 * `ElevenLabsApiCatalog` in `ElevenLabs` has been renamed to `ModelCatalog`
 * `ChunkEvent` has been replaced by `DeltaEvent`. The `onChunk(ChunkEvent)` method
   on `ListenerInterface` is now `onDelta(DeltaEvent)`. Update all implementations:
   - `onChunk(ChunkEvent $event)` → `onDelta(DeltaEvent $event)`
   - `$event->getChunk()` → `$event->getDelta()`
   - `$event->setChunk(...)` → `$event->setDelta(...)`
   - `$event->skipChunk()` → `$event->skipDelta()`
   - `$event->isChunkSkipped()` → `$event->isDeltaSkipped()`
 * Stream generators in bridge `ResultConverter` classes now yield typed
   `DeltaInterface` objects instead of raw strings. Consumers iterating
   `StreamResult::getContent()` that expect `string` chunks must check for
   `TextDelta` instead:
   - `is_string($chunk)` → `$chunk instanceof TextDelta`, then use `$chunk->getText()`
 * New streaming delta types in `Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\`:
   `TextDelta`, `ThinkingDelta`, `ThinkingSignature`, `ThinkingStart`,
   `ToolCallStart`, `ToolInputDelta`, `BinaryDelta`, `ChoiceDelta`,
   `ToolCallComplete`, `ThinkingComplete`. These are yielded by bridge converters during streaming.
 * `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Ollama\OllamaMessageChunk` has been removed.
   Ollama streams now yield semantic deltas like the other bridges:
   - text content → `TextDelta`
   - thinking content → `ThinkingDelta`
   - completed tool calls → `ToolCallComplete`
   - final usage → `TokenUsage`

   ```diff
   -if ($chunk instanceof OllamaMessageChunk) {
   -    echo $chunk->getContent();
   -}
   +if ($chunk instanceof TextDelta) {
   +    echo $chunk->getText();
   +}
   ```
 * `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Perplexity\PerplexitySearchResults`,
   `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Perplexity\PerplexityCitations`, and
   `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Perplexity\StreamListener` have been
   removed. Perplexity now emits generic `MetadataDelta` instances internally,
   which are promoted to result metadata during stream consumption.

   If you relied on those deltas directly, read metadata instead:

   ```diff
   -if ($delta instanceof PerplexitySearchResults) {
   -    $results = $delta->getSearchResults();
   -}
   -if ($delta instanceof PerplexityCitations) {
   -    $citations = $delta->getCitations();
   -}
   +$results = $result->getMetadata()->get('search_results');
   +$citations = $result->getMetadata()->get('citations');
   ```
 * `BinaryResult`, `ChoiceResult`, `ToolCallResult`, and `ThinkingContent` no
   longer implement `DeltaInterface`. Stream generators now yield proper delta
   types instead of result objects:
   - `ToolCallResult` → `ToolCallComplete`: use `$delta instanceof ToolCallComplete`
     and `$delta->getToolCalls()`.
   - `ThinkingContent` → `ThinkingComplete`: use `$delta instanceof ThinkingComplete`
     and `$delta->getThinking()` / `$delta->getSignature()`.
   - `BinaryResult` → `BinaryDelta`: use `$delta instanceof BinaryDelta`
     and `$delta->getData()` / `$delta->getMimeType()`.
   - `ChoiceResult` → `ChoiceDelta`: use `$delta instanceof ChoiceDelta`
     and `$delta->getDeltas()`.
 * `ThinkingContent` has been removed in favor of `ThinkingComplete`.
 * The `Usage` delta class has been removed. Bridges now yield `TokenUsage`
   objects directly in streams instead.

Store
-----

 * The `Retriever` constructor has a new `?EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher` parameter
   inserted as 3rd argument before `LoggerInterface $logger`. If you pass `$logger` positionally,
   update to use a named argument:

   ```diff
   -$retriever = new Retriever($store, $vectorizer, $logger);
   +$retriever = new Retriever($store, $vectorizer, logger: $logger);
   ```
 * Add support for `ScopingHttpClient` in `AzureSearchStore`
 * The `endpointUrl` parameter for `AzureSearchStore` has been removed
 * The `apiKey` parameter for `AzureSearchStore` has been removed
 * The `apiVersion` parameter for `AzureSearchStore` has been removed
 * A `StoreFactory` has been introduced for `AzureSearchStore`
 * The `endpointUrl` parameter for Weaviate `Store` has been removed
 * The `apiKey` parameter for Weaviate `Store` has been removed
 * A `StoreFactory` has been introduced for `Cache`

UPGRADE FROM 0.5 to 0.6
=======================

AI Bundle
---------

 * The `api_key` option for `ElevenLabs` is not required anymore if a `ScopedHttpClient` is used in `http_client` option

Platform
--------

 * The `PlatformFactory` is now in charge of creating `ElevenLabsApiCatalog` if `apiCatalog` is provided as `true`
 * `Symfony\AI\Platform\TokenUsage\TokenUsageInterface` has two new methods:
   `getCacheCreationTokens()` and `getCacheReadTokens()`

UPGRADE FROM 0.4 to 0.5
=======================

Platform
--------

 * The `hostUrl` parameter for `ElevenLabsClient` has been removed
 * The `host` parameter for `ElevenLabsApiCatalog` has been removed
 * The `hostUrl` parameter for `PlatformFactory::create()` in `ElevenLabs` has been renamed to `endpoint`

UPGRADE FROM 0.3 to 0.4
=======================

Agent
-----

 * The `keepToolMessages` parameter of `AgentProcessor` has been removed and replaced with `excludeToolMessages`.
   Tool messages (`AssistantMessage` with tool call invocations and `ToolCallMessage` with tool call results) are now
   **preserved** in the `MessageBag` by default.

   If you were opting in to keep tool messages, just remove the parameter:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, keepToolMessages: true);
   +$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox);
   ```

   If you were explicitly discarding tool messages, use the new parameter:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, keepToolMessages: false);
   +$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, excludeToolMessages: true);
   ```

   If you were relying on the previous default (tool messages discarded), opt in explicitly:

   ```diff
   -$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox);
   +$processor = new AgentProcessor($toolbox, excludeToolMessages: true);
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\Tool\Agent` class has been renamed to `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\Tool\Subagent`:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\Tool\Agent;
   +use Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\Tool\Subagent;

   -$agentTool = new Agent($agent);
   +$subagent = new Subagent($agent);
   ```

AI Bundle
---------

 * The service ID prefix for agent tools wrapping sub-agents has changed from `ai.toolbox.{agent}.agent_wrapper.`
   to `ai.toolbox.{agent}.subagent.`:

   ```diff
   -$container->get('ai.toolbox.my_agent.agent_wrapper.research_agent');
   +$container->get('ai.toolbox.my_agent.subagent.research_agent');
   ```

 * An indexer configured with a `source`, now wraps the indexer with a `Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\ConfiguredSourceIndexer` decorator. This is
   transparent - the configured source is still used by default, but can be overridden by passing a source to `index()`.

 * The `host_url` parameter for `Ollama` platform has been renamed `endpoint`.

Platform
-------

 * The `hostUrl` parameter for `OllamaClient` has been removed
 * The `host` parameter for `OllamaApiCatalog` has been removed
 * The `hostUrl` parameter for `PlatformFactory::create()` in `Ollama` has been renamed to `endpoint`

Store
-----

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer` class has been replaced with two specialized implementations:
   - `Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\SourceIndexer`: For indexing from sources (file paths, URLs, etc.) using a `LoaderInterface`
   - `Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\DocumentIndexer`: For indexing documents directly without a loader

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer;
   +use Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\SourceIndexer;

   -$indexer = new Indexer($loader, $vectorizer, $store, '/path/to/source');
   -$indexer->index();
   +$indexer = new SourceIndexer($loader, $vectorizer, $store);
   +$indexer->index('/path/to/file');
   ```

   For indexing documents directly:

   ```php
   use Symfony\AI\Store\Document\TextDocument;
   use Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\DocumentIndexer;

   $indexer = new DocumentIndexer($processor);
   $indexer->index(new TextDocument($id, 'content'));
   $indexer->index([$document1, $document2]);
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\ConfiguredIndexer` class has been renamed to `Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\ConfiguredSourceIndexer`:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Store\ConfiguredIndexer;
   +use Symfony\AI\Store\Indexer\ConfiguredSourceIndexer;

   -$indexer = new ConfiguredIndexer($innerIndexer, 'default-source');
   +$indexer = new ConfiguredSourceIndexer($sourceIndexer, 'default-source');
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\IndexerInterface::index()` method signature has changed - the input parameter is no longer nullable:

   ```diff
   -public function index(string|iterable|null $source = null, array $options = []): void;
   +public function index(string|iterable|object $input, array $options = []): void;
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\IndexerInterface::withSource()` method has been removed. Use the `$source` parameter of `index()` instead:

   ```diff
   -$indexer->withSource('/new/source')->index();
   +$indexer->index('/new/source');
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\Document\TextDocument` and `Symfony\AI\Store\Document\VectorDocument` classes now only accept
   `string` or `int` types for the `$id` property. The `Uuid` type has been removed and auto-casting to `uuid` in store
   bridges has been removed as well:

   ```diff
    use Symfony\AI\Store\Document\TextDocument;
    use Symfony\AI\Store\Document\VectorDocument;
    use Symfony\Component\Uid\Uuid;

    -$textDoc = new TextDocument(Uuid::v4(), 'content');
    +$textDoc = new TextDocument(Uuid::v4()->toString(), 'content');

    -$vectorDoc = new VectorDocument(Uuid::v4(), [0.1, ...]);
    +$vectorDoc = new VectorDocument(Uuid::v4()->toString(), [0.1, ...]);
    ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\Document\EmbeddableDocumentInterface::getId()` can only return `string` or `int` types now.

 * Properties of `Symfony\AI\Store\Document\VectorDocument` and `Symfony\AI\Store\Document\Loader\Rss\RssItem` have been changed to private, use getters instead of public properties:

   ```diff
   -$document->id;
   -$document->metadata;
   -$document->score;
   -$document->vector;
   +$document->getId();
   +$document->getMetadata();
   +$document->getScore();
   +$document->getVector();
   ```

 * The `StoreInterface::query()` method signature has changed to accept a `QueryInterface` instead of a `Vector`:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Platform\Vector\Vector;
   +use Symfony\AI\Store\Query\VectorQuery;

   -$results = $store->query($vector, ['limit' => 10]);
   +$results = $store->query(new VectorQuery($vector), ['limit' => 10]);
   ```

   The Store component now supports multiple query types through a query abstraction system. Available query types:
   - `VectorQuery`: For vector similarity search (replaces the old `Vector` parameter)
   - `TextQuery`: For full-text search (when supported by the store)
   - `HybridQuery`: For combined vector + text search (when supported by the store)

   Check if a store supports a specific query type using the new `supports()` method:

   ```php
   if ($store->supports(VectorQuery::class)) {
       $results = $store->query(new VectorQuery($vector));
   }
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Store\Retriever` constructor signature has changed - the first two arguments have been swapped:

   ```diff
   -use Symfony\AI\Store\Retriever;
   -
   -$retriever = new Retriever($vectorizer, $store, $logger);
   +$retriever = new Retriever($store, $vectorizer, $logger);
   ```

   This change aligns the constructor with the primary dependency (the store) being first, followed by the optional vectorizer.

UPGRADE FROM 0.2 to 0.3
=======================

Agent
-----

  * The `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\StreamResult` class has been removed in favor of a `StreamListener`. Checks should now target
    `Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\StreamResult` instead.
  * The `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\Source\SourceMap` class has been renamed to `SourceCollection`. Its methods have also been renamed:
    * `getSources()` is now `all()`
    * `addSource()` is now `add()`
  * The third argument of the `Symfony\AI\Agent\Toolbox\ToolResult::__construct()` method now expects a `SourceCollection` instead of an `array<int, Source>`

Platform
--------

 * The `TokenUsageAggregation::__construct()` method signature has changed from variadic to accept an array of `TokenUsageInterface`

   ```diff
   -$aggregation = new TokenUsageAggregation($usage1, $usage2);
   +$aggregation = new TokenUsageAggregation([$usage1, $usage2]);
   ```

 * The `Symfony\AI\Platform\CachedPlatform` has been renamed `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Cache\CachePlatform`
   * To use it, consider the following steps:
     * Run `composer require symfony/ai-cache-platform`
     * Change `Symfony\AI\Platform\CachedPlatform` namespace usages to `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Cache\CachePlatform`
     * The `ttl` option can be used in the configuration
 * Adopt usage of class `Symfony\AI\Platform\Serializer\StructuredOutputSerializer` to `Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\Serializer`

UPGRADE FROM 0.1 to 0.2
=======================

Agent
-----

 * Constructor of `MemoryInputProcessor` now accepts an iterable of inputs instead of variadic arguments.

   ```php
   use Symfony\AI\Agent\Memory\MemoryInputProcessor;

   // Before
   $processor = new MemoryInputProcessor($input1, $input2);

   // After
   $processor = new MemoryInputProcessor([$input1, $input2]);
   ```

AI Bundle
---------

 * Agents are now injected using their configuration name directly, instead of appending Agent or MultiAgent

   ```diff
   public function __construct(
   -   private AgentInterface $blogAgent,
   +   private AgentInterface $blog,
   -   private AgentInterface $supportMultiAgent,
   +   private AgentInterface $support,
   ) {}
   ```

Platform
--------

 * The `ChoiceResult::__construct()` method signature has changed from variadic to accept an array of `ResultInterface`

   ```php
   use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\ChoiceResult;

   // Before
   $choiceResult = new ChoiceResult($result1, $result2);

   // After
   $choiceResult = new ChoiceResult([$result1, $result2]);
   ```

Store
-----

* The `StoreInterface::remove()` method was added to the interface

  ```php
  public function remove(string|array $ids, array $options = []): void;

  // Usage
  $store->remove('vector-id-1');
  $store->remove(['vid-1', 'vid-2']);
  ```

 * The `StoreInterface::add()` method signature has changed from variadic to accept a single document or an array

   *Before:*
   ```php
   public function add(VectorDocument ...$documents): void;

   // Usage
   $store->add($document1, $document2);
   $store->add(...$documents);
   ```

   *After:*
   ```php
   public function add(VectorDocument|array $documents): void;

   // Usage
   $store->add($document);
   $store->add([$document1, $document2]);
   $store->add($documents);
   ```
