Symfony AI - Platform Component
===============================

The Platform component provides an abstraction for interacting with different
models, their providers and contracts.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/ai-platform

Purpose
-------

The Platform component provides a unified interface for working with various AI models, hosted and run by different
providers. It allows developers to easily switch between different AI models and providers without changing their
application code. This is particularly useful for applications that require flexibility in choosing AI models based on
specific use cases or performance requirements.

Usage
-----

The instantiation of the :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Platform` class is
usually delegated to a provider-specific factory, with a provider being
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Replicate, and others.

For example, to use the OpenAI provider, you would typically do something like this::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory;

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform(env('OPENAI_API_KEY'));

With this :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\PlatformInterface` instance you can now interact with the LLM::

    // Generate a vector embedding for a text, returns a Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\VectorResult
    $vectorResult = $platform->invoke('text-embedding-3-small', 'What is the capital of France?');

    // Generate a text completion with GPT, returns a Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\TextResult
    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('What is the capital of France?')));

Depending on the model and its capabilities, different types of inputs and outputs are supported, which results in a
very flexible and powerful interface for working with AI models.

To use several backends behind a single ``Platform`` and route model invocations automatically,
see `Providers and Multi-Provider Platforms`_.

Models
------

The component provides a model base class :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Model` which is a combination of a model name, a set of
capabilities, and additional options. Usually, bridges to specific providers extend this base class to provide a quick
start for vendor-specific models and their capabilities.

Capabilities are a list of strings defined by :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Capability`, which can be used to check if a model
supports a specific feature, like ``Capability::INPUT_AUDIO``, ``Capability::OUTPUT_IMAGE``, or ``Capability::THINKING``.

Options are additional parameters that can be passed to the model, like ``temperature`` or ``max_output_tokens``, and are
usually defined by the specific models and their documentation.

Model Size Variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For providers like Ollama, you can specify model size variants using a colon notation (e.g., ``qwen3:32b``, ``llama3:7b``).
If the exact model name with size variant is not found in the catalog, the system will automatically fall back to the base
model name (``qwen3``, ``llama3``) and use its capabilities while preserving the full model name for the provider.

You can also combine size variants with query parameters::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Ollama\ModelCatalog;

    $catalog = new ModelCatalog();

    // Get model with size variant
    $model = $catalog->getModel('qwen3:32b');

    // Get model with size variant and query parameters
    $model = $catalog->getModel('qwen3:32b?temperature=0.5&top_p=0.9');

Custom models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For providers like Ollama, you can use custom models (built on top of ``Modelfile``), as those models are not listed in
the default catalog. The ``ModelCatalog`` automatically queries the model information from the Ollama API::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Ollama\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform('http://127.0.0.1:11434');

    $platform->invoke('your_custom_model_name', new MessageBag(
        Message::ofUser(...)
    ));

Passing a Model Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of a model name string, you can hand a fully defined model instance to ``Platform::invoke()``. This
skips the catalog lookup entirely and is useful when a provider ships a model that is not (yet) part of the
shipped catalog, without registering it or replacing the catalog::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Gpt;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Capability;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    $model = new Gpt('gpt-newest', [
        Capability::INPUT_MESSAGES,
        Capability::OUTPUT_TEXT,
        Capability::TOOL_CALLING,
    ], ['temperature' => 0.5]);

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, new MessageBag(Message::ofUser(...)));

.. note::

    You must pass a **bridge-specific** model subclass (e.g. ``Gpt``, ``Claude``, ``Gemini``), not the base
    :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Model`. Model clients, result converters, and contract normalizers select
    the right implementation via the concrete class, so a bare ``Model`` instance has no client to handle it.
    The platform routes the instance to the first provider whose model clients accept it; in multi-provider
    setups where the same class is shared (e.g. OpenAI and Azure both use ``Gpt``), the first matching provider
    wins.

Generic Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platforms like `LiteLLM`_ or `OpenRouter`_ provide a unified API to access multiple models from different providers.
Therefore, they rely on endpoint and contract design, that is inspired by OpenAI's original GPT API - an implicit
standard in the industry. Platforms using this de facto standard can be used with the generic bridge::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Generic\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform('https://api.example.com', 'sk-xxxxxx', $httpClient, $modelCatalog);

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a pirate and you write funny.'),
        Message::ofUser('What is the Symfony framework?'),
    );
    $result = $platform->invoke('model-name', $messages);

    echo $result->asText();

This requires to configure a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Generic\\ModelCatalog` explicitly, using
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Generic\\CompletionsModel` or :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Generic\\EmbeddingsModel`,
see `LiteLLM example`_ for more details.

Alternatively, use the :doc:`models.dev bridge <platform/models-dev>` to
auto-discover model capabilities for many providers without manually curating
model catalogs.

See :doc:`platform/model-catalogs` for keeping catalogs current, adding custom
models, or bypassing the catalog.

Providers and Multi-Provider Platforms
--------------------------------------

A :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Platform` is a router over one or more
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ProviderInterface` instances. A provider encapsulates
everything needed to talk to a single inference backend (model clients, result
converters, contract, model catalog). The standalone ``Factory::createPlatform()``
method is a convenience that wraps a single provider in a ``Platform``.

For multi-provider setups, build the platform manually from multiple providers.
The :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelRouter\\CatalogBasedModelRouter` (the default)
routes each invocation to the first provider whose catalog knows the requested model::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Anthropic\Factory as AnthropicFactory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory as OpenAiFactory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Platform;

    $platform = new Platform([
        OpenAiFactory::createProvider(apiKey: env('OPENAI_API_KEY')),
        AnthropicFactory::createProvider(apiKey: env('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')),
    ]);

    $platform->invoke('gpt-4o', $messages);             // → OpenAI
    $platform->invoke('claude-3-5-sonnet', $messages);  // → Anthropic

Provider instances also support an optional ``$name`` parameter for connection-level
identity, useful when running several instances of the same bridge (e.g. one OpenAI
connection per region)::

    OpenAiFactory::createProvider(apiKey: env('OPENAI_EU_KEY'), name: 'openai-eu');
    OpenAiFactory::createProvider(apiKey: env('OPENAI_US_KEY'), name: 'openai-us');

Custom Routing Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom routing strategies (load balancing, model-pattern matching, input-based
selection) are implemented as :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelRouterInterface`
implementations passed as the second ``Platform`` constructor argument.

A router receives the requested model, the available providers, and the invocation
input and options. It answers with a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelRouter\\RoutingDecision`, which names the provider
serving the request and — optionally — a model and options replacing the requested
ones. Leaving the model or options at ``null`` keeps the requested values, so a router
that only dispatches between providers never has to think about either::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\ModelRouter\RoutingDecision;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\ModelRouterInterface;

    final class VisionModelRouter implements ModelRouterInterface
    {
        public function __construct(
            private readonly ModelRouterInterface $fallback = new CatalogBasedModelRouter(),
        ) {
        }

        public function resolve(string|Model $model, iterable $providers, array|string|object $input, array $options = []): RoutingDecision
        {
            if (!$input instanceof MessageBag || !$input->containsImage()) {
                return $this->fallback->resolve($model, $providers, $input, $options);
            }

            $decision = $this->fallback->resolve('claude-sonnet-4-5', $providers, $input, $options);

            return new RoutingDecision($decision->getProvider(), 'claude-sonnet-4-5', reason: 'image detected');
        }
    }

Because :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelRouter\\CatalogBasedModelRouter` never
replaces the model, it works as the terminal resolver that model-selecting routers
delegate to: they decide *which* model, and hand the "who serves it" question back to
the default router instead of reimplementing catalog lookup.

The selected model may be a name or a fully defined
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Model`. A name is resolved through the chosen provider's
model catalog; a ``Model`` instance bypasses the catalog and carries its own options,
which lets a router tune options per routing decision::

    return new RoutingDecision(
        $decision->getProvider(),
        new Model('gpt-4o', options: ['temperature' => 0.2]),
        reason: 'deterministic answer requested',
    );

Because providers and models differ in the options they understand, a decision that
redirects a request may also have to rewrite the invocation options — renaming an
option for the selected provider, or dropping one the selected model does not
support::

    unset($options['seed']); // not supported by the selected provider

    return new RoutingDecision($decision->getProvider(), 'claude-sonnet-4-5', $options, 'image detected');

Routing runs for every invocation, including those made with a ``Model`` instance, so a
custom router sees all traffic through the platform.

.. note::

    A router that names a provider unable to serve the selected model causes a
    :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Exception\\ModelNotFoundException` at invocation time.
    Delegating to the default router (as above) resolves the provider from the model and
    avoids constructing such a decision by hand.

Routing Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before resolving a model to a provider, ``Platform`` dispatches a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Event\\ModelRoutingEvent`. Listeners can modify the
model, input, or options, or short-circuit routing entirely by setting a
provider directly::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Event\ModelRoutingEvent;

    $eventDispatcher->addListener(ModelRoutingEvent::class, function (ModelRoutingEvent $event) use ($customProvider) {
        if ('priority-model' === $event->getModel()) {
            $event->setProvider($customProvider);  // skip router, use this provider
        }
    });

``getModel()`` returns the requested model name, or a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Model`
instance when the caller passed one to ``invoke()``. Listeners that match on the model
name should account for both.

Listeners and routers overlap in power — both can change the model, the options,
or the provider — so use them for different jobs: a listener observes or adjusts
an invocation *before* routing (pinning a provider behind a feature flag,
rewriting input, overriding in tests), while the router *is* the routing strategy
that answers which provider and model serve every request. As a rule of thumb:
logic that decides between providers or models belongs in a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelRouterInterface` implementation; logic that
tweaks a request on its way there belongs in a listener. If a listener starts
iterating providers, it wants to be a router.

Provider-level events (:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Event\\InvocationEvent` and
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Event\\ResultEvent`) still fire inside the selected
provider for per-invocation concerns.

Result Conversion Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ResultEvent`` fires when the deferred result *object* is created, before the raw
result is converted. Because :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\DeferredResult` is
lazy, the actual result is only available later. To act on the resolved result, listen
to :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Event\\ResultConvertedEvent`, which is dispatched once
the result has been converted (and :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Event\\ResultErrorEvent`
when conversion fails)::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Event\ResultConvertedEvent;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Event\ResultErrorEvent;

    $eventDispatcher->addListener(ResultConvertedEvent::class, function (ResultConvertedEvent $event) {
        // $event->getResult() is the resolved result; a listener may replace it via setResult()
    });

    $eventDispatcher->addListener(ResultErrorEvent::class, function (ResultErrorEvent $event) {
        // $event->getError() carries the conversion exception (still rethrown to the caller)
    });

A listener exception from ``ResultConvertedEvent`` propagates to the caller and does
not trigger ``ResultErrorEvent``, which fires only when the conversion itself fails.

For a streamed result, ``ResultConvertedEvent`` fires when the stream result is created,
not when it is fully consumed.

Options
-------

The third parameter of the :method:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\PlatformInterface::invoke`
method is an array of options, which basically wraps the options of the corresponding
model and platform, like ``temperature`` or ``max_output_tokens``::

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $input, [
        'temperature' => 0.7,
        'max_output_tokens' => 100,
    ]);

.. note::

    For model- and platform-specific options, please refer to the respective documentation.

Language Models and Messages
----------------------------

One central feature of the Platform component is the support for language
models and easing the interaction with them. This is supported by providing
an extensive set of data classes around the concept of messages and their content.

Messages can be of different types, most importantly :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\UserMessage`, :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\SystemMessage`, or :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\AssistantMessage`, can
have different content types, like :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Text`, :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Image` or :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Audio`, and can be grouped into a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\MessageBag`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Image;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Create a message bag with a user message
    $messageBag = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a helpful assistant.'),
        Message::ofUser('Please describe this picture?', Image::fromFile('/path/to/image.jpg')),
    );

Message Unique IDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each message automatically receives a unique identifier (UUID v7) upon creation.
This provides several benefits:

- **Traceability**: Track individual messages through your application
- **Time-ordered**: UUIDs are naturally sortable by creation time
- **Timestamp extraction**: Get the exact creation time from the ID
- **Database-friendly**: Sequential nature improves index performance

::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;

    $message = Message::ofUser('Hello, AI!');

    // Access the unique ID
    $id = $message->getId(); // Returns Symfony\Component\Uid\Uuid instance

    // Extract creation timestamp
    $createdAt = $id->getDateTime(); // Returns \DateTimeImmutable
    echo $createdAt->format('Y-m-d H:i:s.u'); // e.g., "2025-06-29 15:30:45.123456"

    // Get string representation
    echo $id->toRfc4122(); // e.g., "01928d1f-6f2e-7123-a456-123456789abc"

Message Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message templates allow dynamic variable substitution in messages. Both system and user messages support templates, enabling reusable message patterns with runtime variables.

String Templates
................

String templates use curly braces for variable placeholders::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Template;

    // System message with template
    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem(Template::string('You are a {role} assistant.')),
        Message::ofUser('What is PHP?')
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['role' => 'programming'],
    ]);

User messages also support templates::

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a helpful assistant.'),
        Message::ofUser(Template::string('Tell me about {topic}'))
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['topic' => 'PHP'],
    ]);

Multiple messages can use the same variable set::

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem(Template::string('You are a {domain} assistant.')),
        Message::ofUser(Template::string('Calculate {operation}'))
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'template_vars' => [
            'domain' => 'math',
            'operation' => '2 + 2',
        ],
    ]);

Object Variables
................

Template variables are not restricted to scalar values - objects can be passed as
well. They are normalized into an array first, and since the string renderer
flattens nested arrays into dot-paths, the object's properties are addressable
with dotted placeholders::

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a product copywriter.'),
        Message::ofUser(Template::string('Write a teaser for {product.name}, priced at {product.price} EUR.'))
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['product' => $product],
    ]);

By default, every property the normalizer can read ends up in the prompt. To
control which ones are exposed - for example to keep internal fields out of the
prompt - pass a normalizer context via the ``template_options`` option, such as
serialization groups::

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['product' => $product],
        'template_options' => [
            'normalizer_context' => [
                'groups' => ['prompt'],
            ],
        ],
    ]);

With that context, only properties within the ``prompt`` serialization group are
normalized, and therefore only those can be referenced in the template.

.. note::

    Object variables require a normalizer, see `Setup`_ below. Objects implementing
    ``\Stringable`` are an exception: they are used as-is and not normalized.

Expression Templates
....................

For advanced use cases, expression templates provide dynamic evaluation using Symfony's Expression Language::

    $template = Template::expression('price * quantity');

.. note::

    Expression templates require the ``symfony/expression-language`` component to be installed.

Setup
.....

To use templates, register the ``TemplateRendererListener`` with your platform's event dispatcher::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\EventListener\TemplateRendererListener;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\TemplateRenderer\StringTemplateRenderer;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\TemplateRenderer\TemplateRendererRegistry;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

    $eventDispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
    $rendererRegistry = new TemplateRendererRegistry([
        new StringTemplateRenderer(),
    ]);
    $templateListener = new TemplateRendererListener($rendererRegistry);
    $eventDispatcher->addSubscriber($templateListener);

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, eventDispatcher: $eventDispatcher);

To use objects as template variables, the listener needs a normalizer as second
argument - without it, object variables are rejected with an exception::

    use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Normalizer\ObjectNormalizer;

    $templateListener = new TemplateRendererListener($rendererRegistry, new ObjectNormalizer());

.. note::

    When using the AI Bundle, template rendering is automatically configured and available without manual setup,
    including the ``serializer`` service as normalizer, so object variables work out of the box.

Result Streaming
----------------

Since LLMs usually generate a result word by word, most of them also support streaming the result using Server Side
Events. Symfony AI supports that by abstracting the conversion and yielding semantic
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\DeltaInterface` deltas as content of the result.

The simplest way to consume a stream is ``asTextStream()``, which filters for
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\TextDelta` deltas only::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Platform and LLM

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a thoughtful philosopher.'),
        Message::ofUser('What is the purpose of an ant?'),
    );
    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages, [
        'stream' => true, // enable streaming of response text
    ]);

    foreach ($result->asTextStream() as $delta) {
        echo $delta;
    }

If you need access to all delta types (e.g. tool calls, thinking, metadata), use
``asStream()`` instead::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\TextDelta;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\ToolCallComplete;

    foreach ($result->asStream() as $delta) {
        if ($delta instanceof TextDelta) {
            echo $delta;
        }

        if ($delta instanceof ToolCallComplete) {
            // handle tool calls
        }
    }

The following delta types are available:

* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\TextDelta` -- a chunk of generated text
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ThinkingDelta` -- a chunk of model reasoning
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ThinkingComplete` -- signals thinking is complete, includes accumulated thinking text and optional signature
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ThinkingSignature` -- a cryptographic signature for a thinking block
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ToolCallStart` -- signals the start of a tool call
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ToolInputDelta` -- a chunk of tool call input data
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ToolCallComplete` -- signals all tool calls are complete and ready for execution
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\MetadataDelta` -- metadata associated with the stream
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ChoiceDelta` -- a choice delta (e.g. multiple completions)
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\BinaryDelta` -- a chunk of binary data

Tool calls follow a fixed shape across bridges: every call is announced with a
``ToolCallStart`` at the position it appears in the response, its arguments follow as
``ToolInputDelta`` chunks if the provider streams them, and one final ``ToolCallComplete``
carries all calls of the response ready for execution. The position of a ``ToolCallStart``
relative to the surrounding text and thinking deltas is what the provider generated, which
matters when the assistant message is sent back on a later turn.

.. note::

    A provider that does not identify its tool calls before they are complete only emits
    ``ToolCallComplete``. Consumers should therefore treat ``ToolCallStart`` and
    ``ToolInputDelta`` as optional, and ``ToolCallComplete`` as the authoritative one.

    Multi-candidate responses are the exception to the single terminal ``ToolCallComplete``: the
    Gemini and VertexAI bridges wrap each chunk's candidates in a ``ChoiceDelta`` that carries one
    ``ToolCallComplete`` per function call, without ``ToolCallStart``.

Finish Reason
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every bridge whose provider reports why generation stopped exposes it as the ``finish_reason``
result metadata, for both buffered and streamed results. This is what tells a complete answer
apart from one that was cut off by the output token limit::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\FinishReason\FinishReasonCase;

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages, ['max_tokens' => 50]);

    $finishReason = $result->getMetadata()->get('finish_reason');

    if ($finishReason?->is(FinishReasonCase::LENGTH)) {
        // the answer is truncated -- continue generation or raise the limit
    }

Providers spell the reason differently, so the value is a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\FinishReason\\FinishReason` object that normalizes it into a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\FinishReason\\FinishReasonCase` while keeping the provider's own
wording available::

    $finishReason->getCase(); // FinishReasonCase::LENGTH
    $finishReason->getRaw();  // "max_tokens" on Anthropic, "MAX_TOKENS" on Gemini, "length" on OpenAI

The normalized cases are ``STOP``, ``LENGTH``, ``TOOL_CALL``, ``CONTENT_FILTER``,
``STOP_SEQUENCE`` and ``OTHER``. A provider-specific reason without an equivalent -- such as
Gemini's ``RECITATION`` -- normalizes to ``OTHER``, and ``getRaw()`` tells those apart.

The translation itself lives in the bridge, in a ``FinishReasonMapper`` next to its result converter,
the same way ``TokenUsageExtractor`` is provided per bridge. A new bridge maps its own vocabulary onto
the cases above without touching the Platform component.

.. note::

    The metadata is only set when the provider reports a reason, so guard against ``null``.
    The normalized case reflects what the provider actually reported: a provider that ends a
    tool-call turn with a plain ``stop`` surfaces as ``STOP``, not ``TOOL_CALL``.

When streaming, the reason is only known once the stream has been consumed. It is emitted as
the final ``MetadataDelta``, which ``asStream()`` promotes into the result metadata and skips
from the visible deltas::

    foreach ($result->asTextStream() as $delta) {
        echo $delta;
    }

    // available after the stream has been fully consumed
    $finishReason = $result->getMetadata()->get('finish_reason');

.. note::

    A streamed ``LENGTH`` is not surfaced by every bridge. Some providers -- Anthropic among them --
    treat a truncation at the output token limit as an error mid-stream and throw a
    :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Exception\\MaxOutputTokensException` instead of emitting the reason,
    so the same ``max_tokens`` case that surfaces as ``LENGTH`` on a buffered result raises an exception
    when streamed. Wrap the consumption loop in a ``try``/``catch`` when you need to handle truncation
    of a streamed response.

Custom Tool Calls (Provider Extensions)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some providers report sub-calls of their own built-in tools as a ``custom_tool_call`` output
item -- not part of the official OpenAI Responses specification, but an extension some
providers use for tools they resolve entirely server-side (e.g. xAI's ``x_search`` reporting
the searches it ran as ``x_keyword_search``/``x_semantic_search`` calls). Since the provider
has already executed the call by the time it is reported, the OpenResponses bridge converts it
into a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\CustomToolCallResult` rather than a ``ToolCall`` --
the application is not expected to answer it::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\CustomToolCallResult;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\MultiPartResult;

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages);

    if ($result instanceof MultiPartResult) {
        foreach ($result->getContent() as $part) {
            if ($part instanceof CustomToolCallResult) {
                // $part->getName(), $part->getInput(), $part->getStatus()
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    Like the other built-in server-side tool results, ``custom_tool_call`` items are only
    available on non-streamed responses.

Citations
~~~~~~~~~

Bridges whose provider grounds an answer in web sources expose the URLs as ``citations``
result metadata, a deduplicated list of strings::

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages);

    foreach ($result->getMetadata()->get('citations') ?? [] as $url) {
        // ...
    }

.. note::

    The metadata is only set when the provider reports citations for the response, so
    guard against ``null``.

The Perplexity bridge always reports its own ``citations`` response field this way. The
OpenResponses bridge reports it too, extracted from ``url_citation`` annotations on the
assistant message -- for example when a model uses a citation-grounded built-in tool such
as xAI's ``x_search``.

Streaming in a Symfony Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stream AI responses directly to the browser, wrap the consumption loop in a
``StreamedResponse``. This sends output to the client as soon as each chunk arrives, without
buffering the entire response in memory::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\PlatformInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\StreamedResponse;
    use Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route;

    final class ChatController
    {
        #[Route('/chat/stream', name: 'chat_stream')]
        public function stream(PlatformInterface $platform): StreamedResponse
        {
            $messages = new MessageBag(
                Message::ofUser('Tell me about Symfony.'),
            );

            $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-5-mini', $messages, [
                'stream' => true,
            ]);

            return new StreamedResponse(function () use ($result) {
                foreach ($result->asTextStream() as $text) {
                    echo $text;
                    flush();
                }
            });
        }
    }

For JSON-based streaming (useful with JavaScript frontends), use ``StreamedJsonResponse`` instead,
which formats each chunk as a JSON event that can be consumed by an ``EventSource`` or ``fetch``
reader. For more robust real-time delivery — automatic reconnection or multiplexing across
clients — an additional layer like `Mercure`_ can be used.

Thinking / Extended Reasoning
-----------------------------

Some models support "extended thinking" or "reasoning" where the model
explicitly works through a problem step by step before producing its final
answer. This is exposed through the ``Capability::THINKING`` capability and
the streaming delta types :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ThinkingDelta`
and :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ThinkingComplete`.

Enabling Thinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable thinking, pass the ``thinking`` option when invoking the model. For
Anthropic, the option configures the thinking budget (maximum tokens the model
may use for reasoning)::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Anthropic Platform

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a helpful math tutor.'),
        Message::ofUser('What is the sum of the first 100 prime numbers?'),
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('claude-sonnet-4-5', $messages, [
        'stream' => true,
        'thinking' => [
            'type' => 'enabled',
            'budget_tokens' => 10000,
        ],
    ]);

Consuming Thinking in Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When streaming, the generator yields thinking-related deltas alongside
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\TextDelta` and
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\Stream\\Delta\\ToolCallComplete`
deltas::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\TextDelta;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\ThinkingComplete;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\Stream\Delta\ThinkingDelta;

    foreach ($result->asStream() as $delta) {
        if ($delta instanceof ThinkingDelta) {
            // Incremental reasoning chunk (not shown to the user in most UIs)
            echo '[thinking] ' . $delta->getThinking();

            continue;
        }

        if ($delta instanceof ThinkingComplete) {
            // The full thinking block is complete
            echo '[thinking done] ' . $delta->getThinking() . "\n";

            // Anthropic includes a cryptographic signature for verification
            if (null !== $delta->getSignature()) {
                // Store signature if you need to echo the thinking block
                // back in subsequent requests
            }

            continue;
        }

        if ($delta instanceof TextDelta) {
            echo $delta;
        }
    }

The ``ThinkingComplete`` delta has two methods:

* ``getThinking()`` (string): the model's accumulated reasoning text
* ``getSignature()`` (?string): a cryptographic signature (Anthropic only), required
  when echoing thinking blocks back in multi-turn conversations

Multi-Turn Conversations with Thinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using thinking in multi-turn conversations, Anthropic requires that
thinking blocks from previous assistant turns be included in the conversation
history. The :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\AssistantMessage` accepts a
variadic list of :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\ContentInterface`
parts, including :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Thinking` blocks
that carry the original reasoning text and its provider-specific signature::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\AssistantMessage;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Text;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Thinking;

    // Include the model's thinking from a previous turn
    $assistant = new AssistantMessage(
        new Thinking('Let me work through this step by step...', 'sig_abc123...'),
        new Text('The answer is 42.'),
    );

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::ofUser('What is the meaning of life?'),
        $assistant,
        Message::ofUser('Can you elaborate?'),
    );

In practice you usually do not have to build the parts yourself.
:method:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Message::ofAssistant` accepts strings,
content parts, and result objects, and unwraps them into the matching content
parts (including thinking blocks with their signatures). Passing the result of a
previous invocation back into the message bag is therefore a one-liner::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages)->getResult();

    $messages->add(Message::ofAssistant($result));

:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\MultiPartResult` is unwrapped recursively,
so a result that contains a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ThinkingResult`
followed by a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\TextResult` (and any tool
calls) is replayed in the same order on the next turn.

Checking for Thinking Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check if a model supports thinking before enabling it::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Capability;

    $model = $catalog->getModel('claude-sonnet-4-5');

    if ($model->supports(Capability::THINKING)) {
        $options['thinking'] = ['type' => 'enabled', 'budget_tokens' => 10000];
    }

Prompt Caching (Anthropic)
--------------------------

Anthropic supports `prompt caching`_, which can significantly reduce costs and
latency for repeated prompts. Symfony AI automatically enables prompt caching
when using the Anthropic bridge by annotating the most cacheable regions of the
request with ``cache_control`` markers: the system prompt, the last tool
definition, and the last user message. The system prompt is typically the
largest and most stable region, making it the most effective caching target.

The caching behavior is configured via the ``cacheRetention`` parameter on the
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Anthropic\\ModelClient`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Anthropic\Factory;

    // Using the Factory (defaults to 'short')
    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey);

    // Explicitly setting the cache retention
    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, cacheRetention: 'long');

    // Disabling prompt caching
    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, cacheRetention: 'none');

Supported values:

* ``short`` (default): 5-minute cache window using Anthropic's ephemeral TTL
* ``long``: 1-hour cache window (only available on ``api.anthropic.com``)
* ``none``: disables prompt caching entirely

.. note::

    OpenAI caches prompt prefixes automatically without any configuration needed.

Image Processing
----------------

Some LLMs also support images as input, which Symfony AI supports as content
type within the :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\UserMessage`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Image;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\ImageUrl;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Platform, LLM & agent

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are an image analyzer bot that helps identify the content of images.'),
        Message::ofUser(
            'Describe the image as a comedian would do it.',
            Image::fromFile(dirname(__DIR__).'/tests/fixtures/image.jpg'), // Path to an image file
            Image::fromDataUrl('data:image/png;base64,...'), // Data URL of an image
            new ImageUrl('https://foo.com/bar.png'), // URL to an image
        ),
    );
    $result = $agent->call($messages);

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Binary Image Input with GPT`_
* `Image URL Input with GPT`_

Document Processing
-------------------

Models that support document understanding can receive PDF files through the
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Document` content type within a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\UserMessage`. This is useful for extracting
information, summarizing content, or answering questions about a document::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Document;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Platform, LLM & agent

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::ofUser(
            'Summarize the key points of this document.',
            Document::fromFile('/path/to/report.pdf'), // Path to a PDF file
        ),
    );
    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-5-mini', $messages);

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `PDF Input with GPT`_
* `PDF Input with Claude`_

Audio Processing
----------------

Similar to images, some LLMs also support audio as input, which is just another content type within the
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\UserMessage`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Audio;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Platform, LLM & agent

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::ofUser(
            'What is this recording about?',
            Audio::fromFile('/path/audio.mp3'), // Path to an audio file
        ),
    );
    $result = $agent->call($messages);

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Audio Input with GPT`_

Text-to-Speech
--------------

Beyond consuming audio, some models can generate audio from text. Pass a plain
string as input and configure the voice and instructions through options. The
result exposes the generated audio as binary data, which can be written to a file::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\TextToSpeech\Voice;

    // Initialize Platform

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini-tts', 'Welcome to Symfony AI!', [
        'voice' => Voice::CORAL,
        'instructions' => 'Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.',
    ]);

    // Write the audio binary to a file
    file_put_contents('output.mp3', $result->asBinary());

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Audio Output with GPT`_

Speech-to-Text
--------------

Some models can transcribe audio into text. Pass an
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Audio` as input and read the transcript
through ``asText()``::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\ElevenLabs\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\Audio;

    // Initialize Platform

    $result = $platform->invoke(
        model: 'scribe_v2',
        input: Audio::fromFile('/path/audio.mp3'),
    );

    echo $result->asText(); // "Hello there"

ElevenLabs Scribe accepts provider-specific options that are forwarded to the
``/v1/speech-to-text`` request, such as ``language_code``, ``diarize``,
``num_speakers``, ``timestamps_granularity`` and ``additional_formats``. When
``additional_formats`` is requested, the result is exposed as a structured
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\ElevenLabs\\Result\\Transcript` object through
``asObject()`` instead of a plain text result::

    $result = $platform->invoke(
        model: 'scribe_v2',
        input: Audio::fromFile('/path/audio.mp3'),
        options: [
            'language_code' => 'en',
            'diarize' => true,
            'timestamps_granularity' => 'word',
            'additional_formats' => [
                ['format' => 'srt', 'include_timestamps' => true],
            ],
        ],
    );

    echo $result->asObject()->getText(); // the plain transcript
    echo $result->asObject()->asSubRipText(); // the SRT subtitles
    echo $result->asObject()->getAdditionalFormat('srt'); // the SRT subtitles

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text with SRT`_

Document OCR
------------

Mistral's ``mistral-ocr-latest`` model uses a dedicated ``/v1/ocr`` endpoint that extracts text
(as markdown), layout images and per-page annotations from a document or image. Unlike chat
completions, it is invoked with a single document content object - a
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\DocumentUrl`,
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\Document` (binary PDF) or
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Message\\Content\\ImageUrl` - and returns a typed
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Mistral\\Ocr\\Result\\OcrResult`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Mistral\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Mistral\Ocr\Result\OcrResult;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Content\DocumentUrl;

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey);

    $result = $platform->invoke('mistral-ocr-latest', new DocumentUrl('https://example.com/document.pdf'));

    $ocr = $result->asObject();
    \assert($ocr instanceof OcrResult);

    echo $ocr->getMarkdown();

The result exposes every ``Page`` with its markdown, dimensions, extracted layout images
(with bounding boxes) and optional annotations.

Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `OCR with Mistral (URL)`_
* `OCR with Mistral (binary)`_

Embeddings
----------

Creating embeddings of word, sentences, or paragraphs is a typical use case around the interaction with LLMs.

The standalone usage results in a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Vector\\Vector` instance::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Embeddings;

    // Initialize platform

    $vectors = $platform->invoke('text-embedding-3-small', $textInput)->asVectors();

    dump($vectors[0]->getData()); // returns something like: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]

Code Examples

* `Embeddings with OpenAI`_
* `Embeddings with Voyage`_
* `Multimodal embeddings with Voyage`_
* `Embeddings with Mistral`_

Structured Output
-----------------

A typical use-case of LLMs is to classify and extract data from unstructured sources, which is supported by some models
by features like Structured Output or providing a Response Format.

PHP Classes as Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symfony AI supports that use-case by abstracting the hustle of defining and providing schemas to the LLM and converting
the result back to PHP objects.

To achieve this, the ``Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\PlatformSubscriber`` needs to be registered with the platform::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Mistral\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\PlatformSubscriber;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Tests\Fixtures\StructuredOutput\MathReasoning;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

    $dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
    $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new PlatformSubscriber());

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, eventDispatcher: $dispatcher);
    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.'),
        Message::ofUser('how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23'),
    );
    $result = $platform->invoke('mistral-small-latest', $messages, ['response_format' => MathReasoning::class]);

    dump($result->asObject()); // returns an instance of `MathReasoning` class

Array Structures as Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also PHP array structures as ``response_format`` are supported, which also requires the event subscriber mentioned above. On
top this example uses the feature through the agent to leverage tool calling::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;

    // Initialize Platform, LLM and agent with processors and Clock tool

    $messages = new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('What date and time is it?'));
    $result = $agent->call($messages, ['response_format' => [
        'type' => 'json_schema',
        'json_schema' => [
            'name' => 'clock',
            'strict' => true,
            'schema' => [
                'type' => 'object',
                'properties' => [
                    'date' => ['type' => 'string', 'description' => 'The current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.'],
                    'time' => ['type' => 'string', 'description' => 'The current time in the format HH:MM:SS.'],
                ],
                'required' => ['date', 'time'],
                'additionalProperties' => false,
            ],
        ],
    ]]);

    dump($result->getContent()); // returns an array

Populating Existing Object Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of a class name, ``response_format`` also accepts an existing object
instance. The model populates the instance's missing fields while preserving the
values already set, and the very same instance is returned. This is useful for
enriching database records, completing incomplete records, or collecting data
progressively across multiple invocations using the same object.

Provide the object both as a ``template_vars`` entry (to give the model context
about the already known values) and as the ``response_format`` (to populate it).
This relies on the ``TemplateRendererListener`` being registered with a normalizer
so the object's properties can be rendered into the prompt template::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\EventListener\TemplateRendererListener;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Template;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\TemplateRenderer\StringTemplateRenderer;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\TemplateRenderer\TemplateRendererRegistry;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\PlatformSubscriber;
    use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Normalizer\ObjectNormalizer;

    $registry = new TemplateRendererRegistry([new StringTemplateRenderer()]);
    $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new TemplateRendererListener($registry, new ObjectNormalizer()));
    $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new PlatformSubscriber());

    $city = new City(name: 'Berlin');

    $messages = new MessageBag(
        Message::ofUser(Template::string('Research missing data for: {city.name}')),
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['city' => $city],
        'response_format' => $city,
    ]);

    // The same instance is returned with its missing fields filled in
    assert($city === $result->asObject());

To limit which properties are exposed to the model (for example to avoid leaking
internal fields), pass a normalizer context through ``template_options``, such as
serialization groups::

    $result = $platform->invoke($model, $messages, [
        'template_vars' => ['product' => $product],
        'template_options' => [
            'normalizer_context' => [
                'groups' => ['public'],
            ],
        ],
        'response_format' => $product,
    ]);

Scoping the Schema to Serializer Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structured output and tools are often built on top of existing domain objects, where only a subset of the properties
should be exposed to the model. The :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Contract\\JsonSchema\\Factory` accepts an optional
context on both ``buildProperties()`` and ``buildParameters()``. Its ``serializer_groups`` key scopes the generated
schema to the given Symfony Serializer groups::

    use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Attribute\Groups;

    final class Product
    {
        #[Groups(['read', 'write'])]
        public string $name = '';

        #[Groups(['write'])]
        public ?int $price = null;

        #[Groups(['read'])]
        public string $slug = '';

        public string $internalNote = '';
    }

Without a context, all properties are described, which is the default behavior::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Contract\JsonSchema\Factory;

    $factory = new Factory();

    $factory->buildProperties(Product::class);
    // properties: name, price, slug, internalNote

Passing ``serializer_groups`` limits the schema to the properties tagged with one of the given groups::

    $factory->buildProperties(Product::class, ['serializer_groups' => ['write']]);
    // properties: name, price

    $factory->buildProperties(Product::class, ['serializer_groups' => ['read', 'write']]);
    // properties: name, price, slug

The same context is accepted by ``buildParameters()`` for tool method arguments, and it is propagated into nested
schemas, so discriminated sub-schemas (``anyOf``) are scoped the same way.

Validating Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using structured output, you might want to validate the generated data against some constraints. Symfony AI
provides a ``ValidatorSubscriber`` that uses the Symfony Validator component for this purpose.

To enable validation, register the ``ValidatorSubscriber`` with your platform's event dispatcher::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Exception\ValidationException;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\PlatformSubscriber;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\Validator\ValidatorSubscriber;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

    $dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
    $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new PlatformSubscriber());
    $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new ValidatorSubscriber());

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, eventDispatcher: $dispatcher);

    try {
        $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o', $messages, ['response_format' => MathReasoning::class]);
    } catch (ValidationException $e) {
        $violations = $e->getViolations();
        // handle violations
    }

The ``ValidatorSubscriber`` will automatically validate any :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ObjectResult` produced
by the ``PlatformSubscriber``. To use this feature, make sure `symfony/validator` is installed in your project.

Streaming Partial Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``stream: true`` is combined with ``response_format: SomeClass::class``, the platform yields a
progressively-populated instance of the target class on every chunk that materially changes the
recovered structure. Use ``DeferredResult::asStreamedObject()`` to iterate the snapshots and
``DeferredResult::asObject()`` to obtain the final, validated object once the stream completes::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\PlatformSubscriber;

    // Initialize platform with PlatformSubscriber registered on the event dispatcher.

    $messages = new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('Give me a recipe for a Margherita pizza.'));
    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $messages, [
        'stream' => true,
        'response_format' => Recipe::class,
    ]);

    foreach ($result->asStreamedObject() as $recipe) {
        render($recipe); // progressively populated Recipe instance (name, then ingredients, then steps)
    }

    $final = $result->asObject(); // fully materialized Recipe; runs ValidatorSubscriber if registered

``asStreamedObject()`` yields the typed object directly. Under the hood each snapshot is emitted as a
``PartialObjectDelta`` carrying both the typed object (``$delta->getObject()``) and the raw JSON buffer
accumulated so far (``$delta->getBuffer()``); iterate ``asStream()`` instead if you need the raw buffer.
Snapshots are de-duplicated — the listener only emits when the parsed structure actually changes. If the
``ValidatorSubscriber`` is registered, validation runs once on the final object only; partial snapshots
are never validated, since they are by definition incomplete.

Parsing Partial JSON from Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When consuming structured output as a stream, every delta only contains a fragment of the final JSON payload. To
render incremental UI updates (e.g. progressively filling a form, showing a partial list of items, etc.) you need a
parser that can recover the largest valid structure from an incomplete payload. The
``Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\Streaming\PartialJsonParser`` provides exactly that.

The parser first attempts a strict ``json_decode`` and, if that fails, applies best-effort fixes in order:
trailing commas, unclosed strings, dangling colons, partial ``true``/``false``/``null`` literals, and unclosed
``{`` / ``[`` structures::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\StructuredOutput\Streaming\PartialJsonParser;

    $buffer = '';

    foreach ($chunks as $chunk) {
        $buffer .= $chunk;

        $partial = PartialJsonParser::parse($buffer, $errorMessage);

        if (null !== $partial) {
            // render the partial structure (array/object/scalar)
        }
    }

The method is ``static``, stateless, and dependency-free. It returns ``null`` and sets ``$errorMessage`` to the
``json_last_error_msg()`` text only when the input is unrecoverable. On success ``$errorMessage`` is reset to ``null``.

When you already have a streaming ``DeferredResult``, ``asPartialJsonStream()`` wires the parser to the text-delta
stream for you and yields the recovered structure each time it changes::

    $deferred = $platform->invoke('gpt-5-mini', $messages, ['stream' => true]);

    foreach ($deferred->asPartialJsonStream() as $partial) {
        // render the partial structure (array/object/scalar)
    }

The generator skips deltas that leave the recovered structure unchanged and silently swallows buffers that are not
recoverable yet, so a consumer can treat each iteration as a denser snapshot of the same logical value.

Server Tools
------------

Some platforms provide built-in server-side tools for enhanced capabilities without custom implementations:

* :doc:`platform/openai-server-tools` - Web Search, File Search, Code Interpreter, Image Generation, MCP, Computer Use
* :doc:`platform/anthropic-server-tools` - Bash, Text Editor, Code Execution
* :doc:`platform/gemini-server-tools` - URL Context, Google Search, Code Execution
* :doc:`platform/vertexai-server-tools` - URL Context, Google Search, Code Execution

For complete Vertex AI setup and usage guide, see :doc:`platform/vertexai`.

Parallel Platform Calls
-----------------------

Since the ``Platform`` sits on top of Symfony's HttpClient component, it supports multiple model calls in parallel,
which can be useful to speed up the processing::

    // Initialize Platform

    foreach ($inputs as $input) {
        $results[] = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', $input);
    }

    foreach ($results as $result) {
        echo $result->asText().PHP_EOL;
    }

Cached Platform Calls
---------------------

Thanks to Symfony's Cache component, platform calls can be cached to reduce calls and resources consumption::

    use Symfony\AI\Agent\Agent;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Cache\CachePlatform;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\ArrayAdapter;
    use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TagAwareAdapter;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, HttpClient::create());
    $cachePlatform = new CachePlatform($platform, cache: new TagAwareAdapter(new ArrayAdapter()));

    $firstResult = $cachePlatform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('What is the capital of France?')));

    echo $firstResult->getContent().\PHP_EOL;

    $secondResult = $cachePlatform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('What is the capital of France?')));

    echo $secondResult->getContent().\PHP_EOL;

High Availability
-----------------

As most platform exposes a REST API, errors can occurs during generation phase due to network issues, timeout and more.

To prevent exceptions at the application level and allows to keep a smooth experience for end users,
the :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Failover\\FailoverPlatform` can be used to automatically call a backup platform::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Failover\FailoverPlatform;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Ollama\Factory as OllamaFactory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\OpenAi\Factory as OpenAiFactory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;
    use Symfony\Component\RateLimiter\RateLimiterFactory;
    use Symfony\Component\RateLimiter\Storage\InMemoryStorage;

    $rateLimiter = new RateLimiterFactory([
        'policy' => 'sliding_window',
        'id' => 'failover',
        'interval' => '3 seconds',
        'limit' => 1,
    ], new InMemoryStorage());

    // # Ollama will fail as 'gpt-4o' is not available in the catalog
    $platform = new FailoverPlatform([
        OllamaFactory::createPlatform(env('OLLAMA_HOST_URL'), HttpClient::create()),
        OpenAiFactory::createPlatform(env('OPENAI_API_KEY'), HttpClient::create()),
    ], $rateLimiter);

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o', new MessageBag(
        Message::forSystem('You are a helpful assistant.'),
        Message::ofUser('Tina has one brother and one sister. How many sisters do Tina\'s siblings have?'),
    ));

    echo $result->asText().\PHP_EOL;

This platform can also be configured when using the bundle::

    # config/packages/ai.yaml
    ai:
        platform:
            openai:
                # ...
            ollama:
                # ...
            failover:
                ollama_to_openai:
                    platforms:
                        - 'ai.platform.ollama'
                        - 'ai.platform.openai'
                    rate_limiter: 'limiter.failover_platform'

    # config/packages/rate_limiter.yaml
    framework:
        rate_limiter:
            failover_platform:
                policy: 'sliding_window'
                limit: 100
                interval: '60 minutes'

.. note::

    Platforms are executed in the order they're injected into :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Bridge\\Failover\\FailoverPlatform`.

.. note::

    ``FailoverPlatform`` reacts to runtime errors by falling back to the next platform.
    For catalog-based routing (e.g. sending ``gpt-4o`` to OpenAI and ``claude-*`` to Anthropic
    in the same ``Platform`` instance), see `Providers and Multi-Provider Platforms`_.

Testing Tools
-------------

The component ships more than one test double, and which one fits depends on *how much of the
platform the test should keep running*. They cut the pipeline at different depths, from replacing
everything down to replacing nothing but the network:

* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\InMemoryPlatform` replaces the whole platform. Routing, model
  catalog, contract, ``ModelClient`` and ``ResultConverter`` are all skipped, and the answer is a
  string or closure you write. Use it to test *your* code against a given answer.
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\Recording\\RecordingProvider` replaces one provider, keeping the
  real ``Platform``, routing and model catalog. The answer is a real result captured once. Use it when
  a test needs a realistic answer but does not care how the bridge produced it.
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\MockPlatformFactory` keeps the real ``Platform``, ``Provider``,
  routing and contract, and fakes only the ``ModelClient`` and ``ResultConverter``. Use it when the
  test is about the platform itself: model routing and resolution, non-text result types, or
  asserting on the payload the platform built.
* :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\Replay\\CassetteHttpClient` replaces nothing but the network.
  Contract, ``ModelClient`` and ``ResultConverter`` all run for real, against bytes recorded from the
  provider once. Use it when the test is about a bridge's internals.

The lower a tool cuts, the more of the library a test actually covers, and the more setup it needs.
A second axis runs across that: ``InMemoryPlatform`` and ``MockPlatformFactory`` return an answer you
wrote by hand, while the two recorders return what a provider really sent, which is what makes them
drift-checkable.

For unit or integration testing, you can use the :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\InMemoryPlatform`,
which implements :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\PlatformInterface` without calling external APIs.

It supports returning either:

- A fixed string result
- A callable that dynamically returns a simple string or any :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ResultInterface` based on the model, input, and options::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Model;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\InMemoryPlatform;

    $platform = new InMemoryPlatform('Fake result');

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'What is the capital of France?');

    echo $result->asText(); // "Fake result"

Dynamic Text Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $platform = new InMemoryPlatform(
        fn($model, $input, $options) => "Echo: {$input}"
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'Hello AI');
    echo $result->asText(); // "Echo: Hello AI"

Vector Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\VectorResult;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Vector\Vector;

    $platform = new InMemoryPlatform(
        fn() => new VectorResult([new Vector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])])
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'vectorize this text');
    $vectors = $result->asVectors(); // Returns Vector object with [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

Binary Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\BinaryResult;

    $platform = new InMemoryPlatform(
        fn() => new BinaryResult('fake-pdf-content', 'application/pdf')
    );

    $result = $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'generate PDF document');
    $binary = $result->asBinary(); // Returns the binary data as string

You can also save binary results directly to a file using
:method:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\DeferredResult::asFile`::

    $result = $platform->invoke('gemini-2.5-flash-image', $messages);
    $result->asFile('/path/to/output.png'); // Saves the binary content to a file

The method throws a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Exception\\RuntimeException` if the
target directory does not exist or is not writable.

Raw Results
~~~~~~~~~~~

The platform automatically uses the :method:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ResultInterface::getRawResult` from any :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ResultInterface` returned by closures. For string results, it creates an :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\InMemoryRawResult` to simulate real API response metadata.

This allows fast and isolated testing of AI-powered features without relying on live providers or HTTP requests.

.. note::

    This requires `cURL` and the `ext-curl` extension to be installed.

Routing-Aware Mock Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``InMemoryPlatform`` replaces the *whole* platform, so it ignores routing and returns text only.
When a test needs to go through real model routing, coexist with real providers, return non-text
results, or assert on exactly what was sent, use the provider-level mock from
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\MockPlatformFactory` instead. It registers as a regular provider and
threads a scripted :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Result\\ResultInterface` through unchanged, so
every result type is supported.

The scripted response can be a fixed string, a map keyed by model name, or a closure::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockPlatformFactory;

    // 1. Fixed string - every call returns a TextResult
    $platform = MockPlatformFactory::createPlatform('Mock result');
    echo $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'What is the capital of France?')->asText(); // "Mock result"

    // 2. Map keyed by model name - per-model response
    $platform = MockPlatformFactory::createPlatform([
        'gpt-4o-mini' => 'cheap answer',
        'gpt-4o' => 'expensive answer',
    ]);

    // 3. Closure - full control, branch on the payload or options
    $platform = MockPlatformFactory::createPlatform(
        fn ($model, $payload, $options) => "Echo: {$payload}"
    );

Because the result is passed through verbatim, structured output, embeddings, streams and tool
calls work the same way::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\ObjectResult;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\VectorResult;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockPlatformFactory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Vector\Vector;

    $platform = MockPlatformFactory::createPlatform(fn () => new ObjectResult((object) ['city' => 'Paris']));
    echo $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'extract the city')->asObject()->city; // "Paris"

    $platform = MockPlatformFactory::createPlatform(fn () => new VectorResult([new Vector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])]));
    $vectors = $platform->invoke('text-embedding-3-small', 'vectorize')->asVectors();

The mock records every call, so a test can assert on the exact payload and options the platform
built (tool option translation, merged model options, and so on). Build the provider yourself to
keep a reference to its :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\MockModelClient`::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\ModelCatalog\FallbackModelCatalog;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Platform;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Provider;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockModelClient;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockResultConverter;

    $client = new MockModelClient('ok');
    $provider = new Provider('mock', [$client], [new MockResultConverter()], new FallbackModelCatalog());
    $platform = new Platform([$provider]);

    $platform->invoke('gpt-4o-mini', 'Hello', ['temperature' => 0.5]);

    $calls = $client->getCalls();
    // $calls[0]['model']->getName() === 'gpt-4o-mini'
    // $calls[0]['options'] === ['temperature' => 0.5]

By default the factory uses a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\ModelCatalog\\FallbackModelCatalog`,
so any model name resolves to the mock. To gate which model names route to the mock - for example
in a multi-provider routing test - pass a :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\MockModelCatalog` with
explicit models instead::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Capability;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Model;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockModelCatalog;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\MockPlatformFactory;

    $provider = MockPlatformFactory::createProvider('mock answer', new MockModelCatalog([
        'mock-model' => ['class' => Model::class, 'capabilities' => [Capability::INPUT_MESSAGES]],
    ]));
    // $provider->supports('mock-model') === true
    // $provider->supports('gpt-4o') === false

Recording Real Provider Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a test only needs a realistic, deterministic answer from a provider, wrap a real provider in
:class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\Recording\\RecordingProvider`. The first run, when the cassette
file does not exist yet, calls the real provider and captures its result into the cassette; commit
the cassette and later runs replay it offline, so the real provider is never called and needs no API
key. Delete the cassette to re-record::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Anthropic\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\Recording\Cassette;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\Recording\RecordingProvider;

    $provider = new RecordingProvider(
        Factory::createProvider($_SERVER['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] ?? 'no-key-needed-on-replay'),
        new Cassette(__DIR__.'/fixtures/weather.json'),
    );

    $result = $provider->invoke('claude-sonnet-4-5', $messages);

By default the mode follows the cassette file: record when it is missing, replay when it exists. Pass
the third constructor argument to force a mode - for example ``record: false`` in CI to fail loudly
instead of issuing a real request when a cassette is missing::

    // force replay (never call the real provider)
    $provider = new RecordingProvider($realProvider, $cassette, record: false);

The recorded interaction is matched by a signature derived from the model, input and options, so a
replayed call must use the same arguments. An input that legitimately differs between runs, such as
a timestamp or retrieved context, would otherwise miss its own recording; pass a ``signature``
closure to normalize those parts before hashing::

    $provider = new RecordingProvider($realProvider, $cassette, signature: fn ($model, $input, $options) => hash(
        'xxh128',
        preg_replace('/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/', '<date>', json_encode([$model, $input, $options])),
    ));

Supported result types are text, structured output (``ObjectResult``), embeddings (``VectorResult``),
tool calls (``ToolCallResult``) and text streams; result metadata and token usage are not preserved.

A cassette stores the model name, the signature and the result. The input itself is never written,
only its hash, but a recorded answer can still repeat back what the prompt contained, so treat a
cassette like any other committed fixture.

.. note::

    On replay the recorded result is returned verbatim, so the bridge ``ResultConverter`` runs only
    at record time. To exercise bridge internals offline, record at the HTTP boundary with
    :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\Replay\\CassetteHttpClient` instead, described next.

Recording Real Responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To exercise a bridge's *internals* (its Contract normalizers, ``ModelClient`` payload building and
``ResultConverter``) against realistic data without a network, record a real HTTP response once and
replay it offline. :class:`Symfony\\AI\\Platform\\Test\\Replay\\CassetteHttpClient` is an
``HttpClientInterface`` you pass to any real bridge ``Factory``; because replay serves a real
``MockResponse``, the **real** converter runs on replay (unlike the mocks above, which bypass it).

By default the mode follows the cassette file: record when it is missing, replay when it exists
(override with an explicit ``record:`` argument). Record once with a real API key, commit the
generated cassette, and replay it in CI::

    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Mistral\Factory;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\Message;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Message\MessageBag;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\Replay\CassetteHttpClient;
    use Symfony\AI\Platform\Test\Replay\HttpCassette;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

    $cassette = new HttpCassette(__DIR__.'/fixtures/mistral_chat.json');

    // cassette missing (+ real key) -> hits the live API and writes the cassette (secrets redacted)
    // cassette exists -> serves the recorded response; the real Mistral ResultConverter runs
    $http = new CassetteHttpClient($cassette, HttpClient::create());

    $platform = Factory::createPlatform($apiKey, $http);
    $result = $platform->invoke('mistral-large-latest', new MessageBag(Message::ofUser('Hello')));

    echo $result->asText(); // produced by the real converter from the recorded bytes

Recorded interactions replay first-in-first-out (like ``MockHttpClient`` with an array of responses).
A streamed response is stored with its raw Server-Sent Event body, so the bridge's stream parser frames
it on replay exactly as it would on the wire, while headers describing the live transfer
(``content-length``, ``content-encoding``, ...) are dropped because they would contradict the replayed
body. Credentials (``Authorization``, ``x-api-key``, ``x-goog-api-key``, the ``auth_bearer`` shorthand,
cookies and provider account identifiers) are replaced with ``[redacted]`` in both request and response
headers before the cassette is written, so a cassette is safe to commit. Per-request trace headers
(``date``, ``cf-ray``, correlation and request ids, proxy latencies) are dropped on write, so that
re-recording a cassette produces a diff of what the provider actually changed instead of noise;
rate limiting headers are kept, because the converters read them.
