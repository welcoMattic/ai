MCP Bundle
==========

Symfony integration bundle for `Model Context Protocol`_ using the official MCP SDK `mcp/sdk`_.

Supports MCP capabilities (tools, prompts, resources) as server via HTTP transport and STDIO. Resource templates implementation ready but awaiting MCP SDK support.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/mcp-bundle

Usage
-----

An application can act as an MCP **server** (exposing tools, prompts and resources to clients), as an MCP
**client** (consuming remote MCP servers), or as both. The two live side by side in the ``mcp`` section of
``config/packages/mcp.yaml``: servers under ``servers:``, clients under ``clients:``. Both keys take named
entries, so an application can expose several servers and use several clients at once.

You also need to add few lines in the routing configuration for this bundle:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/routes.yaml
    mcp:
        resource: .
        type: mcp


Act as Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use your application as an MCP server, exposing tools, prompts, resources, and resource templates to
clients like `Claude Desktop`_, declare a server under ``servers:``. Each server names the transports it
offers (STDIO, HTTP or both) and the capabilities it exposes:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                name: 'my-app'
                transports:
                    stdio: true
                    http: true
                http:
                    path: /mcp
                registry: '*'         # expose every registered capability

A server exposes **only what its** ``registry:`` **lists**. It takes either one list covering every kind
of capability, or a map narrowing each kind separately. Entries are service ids, class names, namespace
prefixes (written with a trailing backslash) or the ``*`` wildcard, as described in
*Exposing capabilities* below.

Creating MCP Capabilities
.........................

MCP capabilities are registered using PHP attributes on services: every service carrying one of the MCP attributes is
picked up automatically at container compile time. In a default Symfony application (with autoconfiguration
enabled and the classes in ``src/`` registered as services) it is enough to add the attribute to a class.

Tools
^^^^^

Actions that can be executed::

    use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpTool;
    use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\Schema;

    class CurrentTimeTool
    {
        #[McpTool(name: 'current-time')]
        public function getCurrentTime(
            #[Schema(description: 'PHP date format string. Default: Y-m-d H:i:s')]
            string $format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s'
        ): string
        {
            return (new \DateTime('now', new \DateTimeZone('UTC')))->format($format);
        }
    }

Prompts
^^^^^^^

System instructions for AI context::

    use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpPrompt;

    class TimePrompts
    {
        #[McpPrompt(name: 'time-analysis')]
        public function getTimeAnalysisPrompt(): array
        {
            return [
                ['role' => 'user', 'content' => 'You are a time management expert.']
            ];
        }
    }

Resources
^^^^^^^^^

Static data that can be read::

    use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpResource;

    class TimeResource
    {
        #[McpResource(uri: 'time://current', name: 'current-time')]
        public function getCurrentTimeResource(): array
        {
            return [
                'uri' => 'time://current',
                'mimeType' => 'text/plain',
                'text' => (new \DateTime('now'))->format('Y-m-d H:i:s')
            ];
        }
    }

Resource Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dynamic resources with parameters:

.. note::

    Resource Templates are not yet functional as the underlying MCP SDK is missing the required handlers.
    See `MCP SDK issue #9 <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk/issues/9>`_ for implementation status.

::

    use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpResourceTemplate;

    class TimeResourceTemplate
    {
        #[McpResourceTemplate(uriTemplate: 'time://{timezone}', name: 'time-by-timezone')]
        public function getTimeByTimezone(string $timezone): array
        {
            $time = (new \DateTime('now', new \DateTimeZone($timezone)))->format('Y-m-d H:i:s T');
            return [
                'uri' => "time://$timezone",
                'mimeType' => 'text/plain',
                'text' => $time
            ];
        }
    }

All capabilities are collected from the service container when it is compiled: the attributes are
reflected once, including the generation of the tool input schemas, and the result is cached in the
compiled container. Classes that are not registered as services (for example excluded in
``services.yaml`` or shipped by a third-party package) must be registered as services to be exposed.
For fully custom registration logic you can implement ``Mcp\Capability\Registry\Loader\LoaderInterface``;
implementations are autoconfigured with the ``mcp.loader`` tag and run when the server is built.

Exposing capabilities
.....................

Carrying an attribute makes a class *available*; a server's capability lists decide which of them it
*exposes*. Each list entry matches one of:

* ``'*'`` — every registered element of that kind;
* ``App\Mcp\SearchTool`` — that exact class name, or a service id for services registered under one;
* ``App\Mcp\Editor\`` — every element whose class or service id starts with that namespace.

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                registry:
                    tools:
                        - 'App\Mcp\Tool\'          # a whole namespace
                        - 'App\Mcp\SearchTool'      # a single class
                        - 'app.mcp.legacy_lookup'    # a custom service id
                    prompts: ['*']
                    # resources, resource_templates and the app list default to [] — nothing exposed

When every kind comes from the same place, give ``registry`` the list directly instead of repeating it
five times:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                registry: ['App\Mcp\']   # every kind, from this namespace
            everything:
                registry: '*'             # every kind, everywhere

.. note::

    In YAML, write namespace prefixes in single quotes (or unquoted). Inside double quotes every
    backslash has to be doubled.

``registry:`` is required and must end up with at least one non-empty kind, and a pattern that matches no service fails at
compile time — that is nearly always a typo. The reverse is allowed on purpose: a service carrying an
MCP attribute that no server lists (a tool shipped by a third-party bundle, say) is simply not exposed.
Run ``debug:mcp`` to see those listed under *Not exposed by any server*.

Multiple Servers
................

Because ``servers:`` is a map, one application can expose several MCP servers on different routes, each
with its own identity and capability set. A common shape is a public server next to a privileged one:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        servers:
            public:
                name: 'acme'
                transports: { http: true }
                http:
                    path: /mcp
                    allowed_hosts: ['acme.example']
                registry:
                    tools: ['App\Mcp\Public\']
                    resources: ['*']

            editors:
                name: 'acme-editors'
                instructions: 'Editorial tooling. Requires an authenticated editor.'
                transports: { http: true }
                http:
                    path: /mcp/editors
                registry:
                    tools: ['*']
                    prompts: ['*']

Access control is plain Symfony security — the routes have distinct, stable paths, so a firewall or an
``access_control`` rule targets them directly:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/security.yaml
    security:
        access_control:
            - { path: ^/mcp/editors, roles: ROLE_EDITOR }

Each server gets its own registry, session store and HTTP route (named ``_mcp_endpoint_<name>``), and its
own services under ``mcp.server.<name>.*``. Autowire a specific server with ``Mcp\Server $editorsServer``.

.. caution::

    Give every server its own session storage. Session ids are not namespaced by server, so two servers
    sharing a store would accept each other's sessions — across a firewall boundary that is a privilege
    escalation. The defaults already isolate them (``%kernel.cache_dir%/mcp-sessions/<name>`` for the file
    store, the ``mcp-<name>-`` prefix for the cache and framework stores), and a configuration that makes
    two servers share a store is rejected when the container is compiled.

If ``http.path`` is not set, it defaults to ``/mcp/<name>``. That default is always derived from the
server's name rather than from how many servers exist, so adding a second server can never silently move
the first one's endpoint.

Attribute Placement Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MCP SDK, and therefore the MCP Bundle, supports two patterns for placing attributes on your capabilities:

**Invokable Pattern** - Attribute on a class with ``__invoke()`` method::

    #[McpTool(name: 'my-tool')]
    class MyTool
    {
        public function __invoke(string $param): string
        {
            // Implementation
        }
    }

**Method-Based Pattern** - Multiple attributes on individual methods::

    class MyTools
    {
        #[McpTool(name: 'tool-one')]
        public function toolOne(): string { }

        #[McpTool(name: 'tool-two')]
        public function toolTwo(): string { }
    }

MCP Apps
........

`MCP Apps`_ let a tool return an interactive HTML screen (an "app") that the host renders in a
sandboxed iframe instead of plain text — for example a dashboard, a form, or a record viewer. The
bundle registers the underlying UI resource for you and enables the MCP Apps server extension, so you
only write the markup.

A single class is the whole app (similar to a Symfony UX LiveComponent): the ``#[AsMcpApp]`` attribute
carries the linked tool's identity (``name``/``description``) and the HTML shell (``template``), the
constructor carries service dependencies, and a handler method (``render`` by default) produces the
tool result::

    // src/Mcp/WeatherApp.php
    use Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Attribute\AsMcpApp;

    #[AsMcpApp(
        uri: 'ui://weather',
        name: 'get_weather',                 // the linked tool's name (model-facing)
        title: 'Weather',
        description: 'Show the weather for a city as an interactive dashboard.',
        template: 'mcp/weather.html.twig',
    )]
    class WeatherApp
    {
        public function __construct(private WeatherClient $weather)
        {
        }

        // The returned value is the tool result, delivered to the iframe's JS render(model).
        // The input schema is derived from the method signature.
        public function render(string $city): array
        {
            return ['summary' => $this->weather->summaryFor($city)];
        }
    }

The template extends the bundle's base template, which implements the MCP Apps ``postMessage``
handshake, iframe size reporting and a ``render(model)`` hook:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {# templates/mcp/weather.html.twig #}
    {% extends '@Mcp/app/base.html.twig' %}

    {% block style %}.card { font: 1rem system-ui; }{% endblock %}
    {% block body %}<div id="root" class="card"></div>{% endblock %}

    {% block app_script %}
        // Called with the linked tool's result. The iframe shell is static HTML; the per-request
        // data arrives at runtime via the tool-result message, not through Twig.
        function render(model) {
            document.getElementById('root').textContent = model.summary;
        }
    {% endblock %}

The bundle registers the UI resource (with the required ``_meta.ui`` descriptor marker), registers the
tool with its ``ui`` link auto-set to this app (``resourceUri`` plus visibility ``[model, app]``), and
enables the MCP Apps extension. ``uri`` defaults to ``ui://<kebab-class-name>``; the tool ``name``
defaults to that URI slug with dashes replaced by underscores, and the handler method defaults to
``render`` (set the ``method`` argument to use another). The tool is registered only when the handler
method exists — an app without it is a static, tool-less screen.

The base template exposes the blocks ``title``, ``head``, ``style``, ``body`` and ``app_script``
(override ``render(model)`` / ``onToolInput(params)`` there), plus ``sendRpc``, ``callTool`` and
``openLink`` JavaScript helpers. The default ``render(model)`` implements the HTML-over-the-wire path
described below, and interactions are wired declaratively via ``data-call`` / ``data-open`` attributes
(see *Interactive apps* below) — so most apps write no JavaScript at all; override ``app_script`` only
for a fully JS-driven UI.

The template form requires ``symfony/twig-bundle``. For a dynamic shell, omit ``template`` and give the
class an ``__invoke(): TextResourceContents`` method instead (inject
``Symfony\AI\McpBundle\App\McpAppRenderer`` to render Twig with your own context); that method then owns
the returned content and its ``_meta.ui``.

You can declare CSP and permission requirements for the iframe directly on the attribute::

    #[AsMcpApp(
        uri: 'ui://weather',
        name: 'get_weather',
        template: 'mcp/weather.html.twig',
        prefersBorder: true,
        cspConnect: ['https://api.weather.example.com'],
        geolocation: true,
    )]

The MCP Apps extension is enabled on a server as soon as it exposes at least one ``#[AsMcpApp]`` class,
which its ``apps:`` list decides like any other capability:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                registry:
                    apps: ['*']                  # every app; [] (the default) exposes none
            editors:
                registry:
                    apps: ['App\Mcp\App\Editor\'] # only these

Rendering with Twig (HTML-over-the-wire)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recommended way to fill the screen is to render the markup with **Twig on the server** and ship it
in the tool result, rather than building the DOM in JavaScript. The iframe shell stays static (the
protocol reads the UI resource only once), but the per-request tool result can carry an ``html``
string: the base template's default ``render(model)`` injects ``model.html`` into the ``#root`` element
(which the default ``body`` block already provides), so you write **no** client-side rendering code.

Name the fragment template on the attribute via ``toolTemplate`` and return a **context array** from the
handler — the bundle renders that template into the ``html`` field for you, so the handler stays free of
Twig::

    #[AsMcpApp(
        uri: 'ui://weather',
        name: 'get_weather',
        template: 'mcp/weather.html.twig',       // the static iframe shell
        toolTemplate: 'mcp/_weather.html.twig',   // rendered into the tool result's `html`
    )]
    class WeatherApp
    {
        public function __construct(private WeatherService $weather)
        {
        }

        // @return array{forecast: Forecast} — the Twig context, not HTML
        public function render(string $city): array
        {
            return ['forecast' => $this->weather->forecastFor($city)];
        }
    }

The shell only needs styling — the rendered fragment lands in ``#root`` automatically:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {# templates/mcp/weather.html.twig #}
    {% extends '@Mcp/app/base.html.twig' %}
    {% block style %}.card { font: 1rem system-ui; }{% endblock %}
    {# body defaults to <div id="root"></div>; the rendered `html` is injected there #}

Because the markup is Twig, the fragment can ``{% include %}`` partials and use filters such as
``markdown_to_html`` — the same building blocks as the rest of your application. Reach for the JS
``render(model)`` override (shown above) only when you need rich client-side interactivity over a
structured model; for that case inject ``McpAppRenderer`` and return
``['html' => $renderer->renderFragment(...)]`` yourself, or build the DOM from the structured result.

Interactive apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beyond the initial screen, an app can drive further work itself. Declare follow-up tools with
``#[AsMcpAppTool]`` on a method of the app class. Like the primary tool, set ``template`` to have the
bundle render the returned context into ``html``; set ``appOnly: true`` to keep the tool callable from
the app but hidden from the model's ``tools/list`` (the default exposes it to both the model and the
app)::

    use Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Attribute\AsMcpAppTool;

    // ... on the same #[AsMcpApp] class, alongside render() ...

    #[AsMcpAppTool(name: 'set_unit', template: 'mcp/_weather.html.twig', appOnly: true)]
    public function setUnit(string $city, string $unit): array
    {
        return ['forecast' => $this->weather->forecastFor($city, $unit)];
    }

The tool name defaults to the method name in ``snake_case``, its input schema is derived from the method
signature, and the ``ui`` link to the enclosing app is set automatically.

Invoking such a tool from the iframe needs **no JavaScript**: the base template wires DOM attributes to
tool calls. Put ``data-call="<tool>"`` on any control — a ``<button>``, a link, or a
``<form data-call="<tool>">`` (submitted on enter or by a submit button, including one elsewhere bound
via ``form="<id>"``) — and the returned HTML replaces ``#root`` automatically. Arguments come from
``data-arg-*`` attributes (``data-arg-city`` → ``{ city }``) or, for a form, from its named fields.
``data-open="https://…"`` opens an external link.

.. code-block:: html+twig

    <button data-call="set_unit" data-arg-city="{{ city }}" data-arg-unit="celsius">°C</button>

    {# the result HTML lands in #root; the search form below re-runs its tool on submit #}
    <form data-call="get_weather"><input name="city"><button>Go</button></form>

The default ``render(model)`` also keeps the shell's forms in sync: after each result it writes any
scalar context value into a form control of the same ``name``. So having the handler return the value it
was called with (``['city' => $city, 'forecast' => ...]``) refills ``<input name="city">`` on every
result — including the first render — with no extra wiring; a control the user is actively editing is
left untouched.

For full client-side control you can still call ``callTool(name, args)`` from your own ``app_script`` and
render the result yourself, but the declarative attributes cover the common case.

Transport Types
...............

Each server declares its transports under ``transports:``:

- **STDIO Transport** (``stdio``, default ``false``) - For command-line clients, served by
  ``symfony console mcp:server <name>``. A process owns one STDIN/STDOUT pair, so one invocation serves
  exactly one server; the argument may be omitted when only one server enables STDIO.
- **HTTP Transport** (``http``, default ``true``) - For web-based clients and MCP Inspector, using
  streamable HTTP connections on that server's route.

The HTTP transport uses the MCP SDK's ``StreamableHttpTransport`` which supports:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST requests
- Session management with configurable storage (file/memory/cache/framework)
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Proper MCP initialization handshake

DNS Rebinding Protection
........................

By default, the MCP SDK protects the HTTP transport against DNS rebinding attacks by only
accepting requests whose ``Origin``/``Host`` header points to ``localhost``. To expose a
public MCP server, configure the allowed hosts:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                http:
                    allowed_hosts: ['example.com', 'mcp.example.com'] # Replaces the default localhost allowlist

Alternatively, disable the protection entirely (for example when the server sits behind a
reverse proxy that already validates the ``Host`` header) by setting it to ``false``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                http:
                    allowed_hosts: false

Session Storage
...............

The MCP Bundle supports four types of session storage, configured per server. Every server needs its own
storage — see the caution in `Multiple Servers`_.

**File Storage** (default) - Stores sessions on the filesystem:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                session:
                    store: file
                    directory: '%kernel.cache_dir%/mcp-sessions/default' # defaults to this
                    ttl: 3600

**Memory Storage** - Stores sessions in memory (non-persistent):

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                session:
                    store: memory
                    ttl: 3600

**PSR-16 Cache Storage** - Stores sessions in any PSR-16 compliant cache (Redis, Doctrine, APCu, etc.):

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                session:
                    store: cache
                    cache_pool: 'cache.mcp.sessions' # Reference to your cache pool service (PSR-16)
                    prefix: 'mcp-default-' # Optional; defaults to "mcp-<name>-"
                    ttl: 3600

By default, if you don't configure a custom cache pool, the bundle automatically creates ``cache.mcp.sessions`` as a PSR-16 wrapper around Symfony's default ``cache.app`` pool.

To use a custom cache backend, you need to configure a PSR-16 cache service in your ``config/services.yaml``:

.. note::

    Symfony cache pools are PSR-6 by default. The MCP session store requires PSR-16.
    Use ``Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache`` to wrap a PSR-6 pool into PSR-16.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/services.yaml
    services:
        # Define a custom PSR-16 cache service wrapping a PSR-6 pool
        cache.mcp.sessions:
            class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache
            arguments:
                - '@cache.app' # or '@my_redis_pool', '@my_doctrine_pool', etc.

This allows you to store sessions in Redis, a SQL database via Doctrine, or any other PSR-6 cache adapter.
See the `Symfony Cache documentation`_ for more details on configuring cache pools.

**Framework Storage** - Uses Symfony's ``SessionHandlerInterface`` for session persistence::

    mcp:
        servers:
            default:
                session:
                    store: framework
                    prefix: 'mcp-default-' # Optional; defaults to "mcp-<name>-"
                    ttl: 3600

This wraps the configured Symfony session handler (e.g. Redis, database, filesystem — whatever
your application uses for HTTP sessions) with a JSON envelope for application-level TTL.
Expired sessions are cleaned up lazily on read.

The Modern Era
..............

The 2026-07-28 revision drops the ``initialize`` handshake and the session that went with it: every
request describes itself, so any worker can answer any request, and no long-running connection is
needed.

Both eras are served **on the same endpoint**, with nothing to configure. The SDK builds a dispatcher
per era, and the HTTP transport classifies every request before anything else looks at it: an envelope
claiming a modern revision goes to the modern dispatcher, the ``initialize`` handshake and its
session's later requests go to the other. A client picks nothing.

STDIO carries the handshake era alone — it has no per-request envelope to classify — so a server
configured for both transports simply serves the modern era over HTTP only.

By default the HTTP endpoint supports every revision the SDK supports and negotiates with the client.
Narrow the supported revisions through ``protocol_versions``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        servers:
            api:
                protocol_versions: ['2025-11-25', '2026-07-28']
                http:
                    path: /mcp
                registry: '*'

Each era takes what belongs to it. The modern revisions listed become the only ones that leg answers
for; listing none of them refuses the modern era, leaving the handshake one alone. A handshake-era
revision pins the handshake to exactly that one — the SDK either negotiates over everything it knows
or is pinned to a single revision, so narrowing that era to a subset is rejected when the container is
compiled.

The options below tune the modern-era leg. They are inert for handshake-era clients, which keep being
served exactly as before. The converse does not hold: the modern leg is on for every server, including
one written before the revision existed, and it drops things the handshake era offers.

.. caution::

    **The 2026-07-28 revision has no server-initiated requests.** Sampling and roots were removed with
    it, so a handler calling ``$gateway->sample()`` or ``$gateway->listRoots()`` fails for a
    2026-07-28 client — *"This protocol revision has no server-initiated requests: sampling and roots
    were removed with it, so take what you need through tool arguments, resource URIs or server
    configuration instead"* — while the same handler keeps working for handshake-era clients on the
    same endpoint. Both calls are also deprecated as of ``mcp/sdk`` 0.8 (SEP-2577), as is
    ``$gateway->log()``.

    Take what such a handler needs through tool arguments, resource URIs or server configuration
    instead, or guard the call with ``$gateway->supportsSampling()`` / ``$gateway->supportsRoots()``,
    which report what the client of the current request declared. Elicitation is the one ask that
    survived, as a multi round-trip request; see *Request State* below.

    Until the handlers are ready, ``protocol_versions`` is the opt-out: list only handshake-era
    revisions and the server refuses the modern era altogether.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/mcp.yaml
        mcp:
            servers:
                api:
                    protocol_versions: ['2025-11-25'] # handshake era only, no modern leg
                    registry: '*'

Request State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A handler that needs another round trip has nowhere to keep its progress once sessions are gone, so
the state travels through the client and is signed to keep it honest:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            api:
                request_state:
                    key: '%env(MCP_REQUEST_STATE_KEY)%'
                    ttl: 600 # seconds a minted state stays valid

The key must be at least 32 bytes — below that the signature protecting the state is forgeable, so a
shorter literal is refused when the container is compiled, and the SDK refuses one arriving from an
env variable at runtime. **The same value must reach every process that might serve the retry**: a
per-worker random key makes the follow-up request fail signature validation.

Two kinds of handler need it. One returns an ``InputRequiredResult`` itself. The other simply calls
``$gateway->elicit()``: on the modern leg the ask ends the request and the client re-sends the whole
call with the answer, so a handler that asks more than once has to carry the earlier answers to the
next round, and carrying them is what needs the key. A handler that asks exactly once never mints
state and works without one. Missing the key, the ask is answered with a JSON-RPC internal error and
the reason is logged on the ``mcp`` channel.

Cache Hints
^^^^^^^^^^^

Without a session the client caches instead, and the revision expects the server to say for how long.
``ttl_ms: 0`` (the default) refuses caching:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            api:
                cache:
                    ttl_ms: 5000
                    scope: private # or "public"
                    methods:
                        'tools/list': { ttl_ms: 60000, scope: public }
                        'resources/read': { ttl_ms: 1000 }

Use ``public`` only for answers that do not vary by caller — anything shaped by the current user must
stay ``private``.

Subscriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``subscriptions/listen`` replaces the held-open HTTP GET stream. Delivery needs a bus, and the choice
depends on your runtime:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        servers:
            api:
                subscriptions:
                    bus: cache # none (default), memory, or cache
                    cache_pool: 'cache.mcp.notifications'
                    lifetime: 30.0 # seconds before the server closes a stream gracefully

Under PHP-FPM the process publishing a notification is not the one holding the stream, so ``memory``
cannot reach it — use ``cache``. ``memory`` suits a single-process runtime; ``lifetime: 0`` holds the
stream until the client or the runtime ends it.

``cache.mcp.notifications`` is auto-created as a PSR-16 wrapper around ``cache.app`` when you leave it
at its default, exactly as the session store is. Each server namespaces its own keys inside that pool,
so two servers can share it without reading each other's notifications.

Only registry changes — the four ``list_changed`` notifications — are published for you. Everything
else, ``notifications/resources/updated`` above all, is your application publishing it. Inject the
server's bus to do that::

    use Mcp\Schema\Notification\ResourceUpdatedNotification;
    use Mcp\Server\Subscription\NotificationBusInterface;

    class DocumentSaver
    {
        public function __construct(
            private NotificationBusInterface $apiNotificationBus,
        ) {
        }

        public function save(Document $document): void
        {
            // ...
            $this->apiNotificationBus->publish(new ResourceUpdatedNotification($document->uri()));
        }
    }

The argument name follows the server name, as ``$defaultNotificationBus`` for a server called
``default``; the service id is ``mcp.server.<name>.notification_bus``.

Act as Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To consume remote MCP servers, declare a client under ``clients:``. A client is a named group of server
connections: it carries the identity your application advertises during the handshake, and lists the
remote ``servers`` it talks to over STDIO (a child process) or HTTP:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/mcp.yaml
    mcp:
        clients:
            research:
                client_info:
                    name: 'acme-research'
                    version: '1.0.0'
                servers:
                    github:
                        transport: http
                        url: 'https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/'
                        headers:
                            Authorization: 'Bearer %env(GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN)%'
                    filesystem:
                        transport: stdio
                        command: ['npx', '-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem', '/tmp']

            simple:
                servers:
                    github:
                        transport: http
                        url: 'https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/'

Several clients can reach the same remote server; each keeps its own connection, since identity,
timeouts and handlers are per client. Use a YAML anchor to avoid repeating a definition:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        clients:
            research:
                servers:
                    github: &github
                        transport: http
                        url: 'https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/'
            simple:
                servers:
                    github: *github

You can find a list of example Servers in the `MCP Server List`_.

Using a Client
..............

Each client is available as ``Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Client\McpClientInterface``, autowirable by the
parameter name or with ``#[Target]``. Its connections implement
``Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Client\ServerConnectionInterface``::

    use Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Client\McpClientInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Attribute\Target;

    class ResearchService
    {
        public function __construct(
            #[Target('research')] private McpClientInterface $client,
        ) {
        }

        public function run(string $path): string
        {
            $connection = $this->client->get('filesystem');

            foreach ($connection->getTools() as $tool) {
                // $tool is an Mcp\Schema\Tool
            }

            $result = $connection->callTool('read_file', ['path' => $path]);

            return $result->content[0]->text;
        }
    }

A client is also iterable, which is handy for fanning a question out over every server it knows::

    foreach ($this->client as $name => $connection) {
        $tools[$name] = $connection->getTools();
    }

When exactly one client is configured, a plain ``McpClientInterface`` type hint resolves to it.

Connection Lifecycle
....................

You never call ``connect()``. A connection opens on its first request and closes on kernel reset, so
resolving or iterating a client costs nothing until a request is actually made. That matters most for
the STDIO transport, where connecting spawns a child process: a Messenger worker therefore starts a
fresh process per message rather than carrying a stale one between them. Call ``disconnect()`` on a
connection (or on the client, for all of them) to close early; it reconnects transparently afterwards.

Failures surface as bundle exceptions naming the client and server:
``Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Exception\ConnectionException`` when the handshake fails, and
``RemoteCallException`` when a request does, both implementing
``Symfony\AI\McpBundle\Exception\ExceptionInterface``.

The HTTP transport uses the application's PSR-18 client (``psr18.http_client``, provided by
``symfony/http-client``) unless the ``http_client`` option points at another service.

Server-initiated Requests
.........................

A remote server can ask the client to run a completion (*sampling*), to prompt the user
(*elicitation*), or for the filesystem roots it may work in (*roots*). Point the matching option at a
service implementing the SDK's callback interface; each capability is advertised only when a handler
backs it, because advertising one without a handler earns a "method not found" from the client:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mcp:
        clients:
            research:
                roots: 'App\Mcp\RootsHandler'            # Mcp\Client\Handler\Request\RootsCallbackInterface
                sampling: 'App\Mcp\SamplingHandler'      # Mcp\Client\Handler\Request\SamplingCallbackInterface
                elicitation: 'App\Mcp\ElicitationHandler' # Mcp\Client\Handler\Request\ElicitationCallbackInterface
                capabilities:
                    roots_list_changed: true
                servers:
                    github: { transport: http, url: 'https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/' }

When the set of roots changes, tell the server with ``$connection->sendRootsListChanged()``.

.. caution::

    Roots, sampling and MCP logging are deprecated as of protocol revision 2026-07-28 (SEP-2577), with
    2027-07-28 as the earliest removal. ``mcp/sdk`` 0.8 triggers a deprecation when the handler behind
    each of them is instantiated, so an application still using them sees one per configured handler.
    Because ``forward_server_logs`` defaults to ``true``, a client emits the logging one without opting
    into anything; set it to ``false`` to configure no logging handler at all. The replacements are the
    ones the revision names: directories through tool arguments or resource URIs rather than roots, an
    LLM provider's API directly rather than sampling, and stderr or OpenTelemetry rather than MCP
    logging. Elicitation is not deprecated.

Besides the tool, prompt and resource calls, a connection also exposes
``$connection->complete($ref, $argument)`` to complete one argument of a prompt or resource template,
and ``$connection->getProtocolVersion()`` for the revision negotiated with that server (``null`` until
the first request opens the connection).

Logging notifications received from remote servers are written to the ``mcp`` logger channel; set
``forward_server_logs: false`` to drop them.

Logging Configuration
---------------------

By default, MCP uses a dedicated logger channel that inherits your application's default logging
configuration. It carries both the server side and the outbound client traffic, including the logging
notifications remote servers send back.
To configure MCP-specific logging, add the following to your ``config/packages/monolog.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/monolog.yaml
    monolog:
        channels: ['mcp']
        handlers:
            mcp:
                type: rotating_file
                path: '%kernel.logs_dir%/mcp.log'
                level: info
                channels: ['mcp']
                max_files: 30

You can customize the logging level and destination according to your needs:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example: Different levels per environment
    monolog:
        handlers:
            mcp_dev:

Debug Command
-------------

``debug:mcp`` is the one debug command for the bundle: it covers both the servers this application
exposes and the clients it uses. Without options it lists the MCP capabilities each configured server
exposes — useful to verify that an attributed class was actually picked up (it must be a registered,
autoconfigured service *and* be matched by a server's capability list) — followed by a summary of the
configured clients:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # list every server's tools, prompts, resources, and resource templates with their handlers
    $ php bin/console debug:mcp

    # restrict the output to one server
    $ php bin/console debug:mcp --server=editors

    # show the details of a single element, including the tool's input schema
    $ php bin/console debug:mcp current-time

Its last section, *Not exposed by any server*, lists the services that carry an MCP attribute but that no
server's capability list matches.

The same command covers the client side. Both listings read the compiled container and open no
connection; only ``--client`` connects, and it always disconnects afterwards:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # list the configured clients and their servers
    $ php bin/console debug:mcp --clients

    # connect and show the remote server's info, instructions, tools, prompts and resources
    $ php bin/console debug:mcp --client=research --server=github

``--server`` names a configured server on its own, and the client's remote server when combined with
``--client``. It can be omitted when the client reaches exactly one server.

Profiler
--------

When the Symfony Web Profiler is enabled, the MCP Bundle automatically adds a dedicated panel showing the registered MCP capabilities of every configured server:

.. image:: images/profiler-mcp.png
   :alt: MCP Profiler Panel

The profiler displays, per server:

- **Tools**: All registered MCP tools with their descriptions and input schemas
- **Prompts**: Available prompts with their arguments and requirements
- **Resources**: Static resources with their URIs and MIME types
- **Resource Templates**: Dynamic resource templates with URI patterns

This makes it easy to inspect and debug your MCP server capabilities during development.

Event System
------------

The MCP Bundle automatically configures the Symfony EventDispatcher to work with the MCP SDK's event system.
This allows you to listen for changes to your server's capabilities.

Available Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCP SDK dispatches the following events when capabilities are registered:

- ``Mcp\Event\ToolListChangedEvent`` - When a tool is registered
- ``Mcp\Event\ResourceListChangedEvent`` - When a resource is registered
- ``Mcp\Event\ResourceTemplateListChangedEvent`` - When a resource template is registered
- ``Mcp\Event\PromptListChangedEvent`` - When a prompt is registered

Listening to Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create event listeners to respond to capability changes::

    use Mcp\Event\ToolListChangedEvent;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Attribute\AsEventListener;

    #[AsEventListener]
    class McpCapabilityListener
    {
        public function onToolListChanged(ToolListChangedEvent $event): void
        {
            // Handle tool registration
            // For example: invalidate cache, log changes, notify clients
        }
    }

The events are simple marker events that notify when lists have changed, but don't contain specific details about what was added or modified.
