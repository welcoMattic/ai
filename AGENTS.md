# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Symfony AI monorepo containing multiple components and bundles that integrate AI capabilities into PHP applications. The project is organized as a collection of independent packages under the `src/` directory, each with their own composer.json, tests, and dependencies.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Platform** (`src/platform/`): Unified interface to AI platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Gemini, VertexAI, etc.)
- **Agent** (`src/agent/`): Framework for building AI agents that interact with users and perform tasks
- **Chat** (`src/chat/`): Chat interface components for building conversational AI applications
- **Store** (`src/store/`): Data storage abstraction with indexing and retrieval for vector databases
- **Mate** (`src/mate/`): AI-powered coding assistant for PHP development

### Bridges
Each core component has bridges in `src/<component>/src/Bridge/` that provide integrations with specific third-party services. Bridges are dedicated Composer packages with their own dependencies and can be installed independently.

### Integration Bundles
- **AI Bundle** (`src/ai-bundle/`): Symfony integration for Platform, Store, and Agent components
- **MCP Bundle** (`src/mcp-bundle/`): Symfony integration for official MCP SDK

### Supporting Directories
- **Examples** (`examples/`): Standalone examples demonstrating component usage across different AI platforms
- **Demo** (`demo/`): Full Symfony web application showcasing components working together
- **Fixtures** (`fixtures/`): Shared test fixtures for multi-modal testing (images, audio, PDFs)

## Development Commands

### Testing
Each component has its own test suite. Run tests for specific components:
```bash
# Platform component
cd src/platform && vendor/bin/phpunit

# Agent component
cd src/agent && vendor/bin/phpunit

# AI Bundle
cd src/ai-bundle && vendor/bin/phpunit

# Demo application
cd demo && vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Code Quality
The project uses PHP CS Fixer with Symfony coding standards. Always run from the repository root:
```bash
# Fix code style issues
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix

# Fix specific directories
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src/platform/
```

Static analysis with PHPStan (component-specific):
```bash
cd src/platform && vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

### Documentation Validation
After adding or changing any RST files in `docs/`, always run the `doctor-rst` validator from the repository root:
```bash
./doctor-rst
```
This uses Docker (`oskarstark/doctor-rst`) to validate RST documentation files and catch formatting issues.

### Cookbook Website Artifacts
The RST files in `docs/cookbook/` are the single source of truth for the cookbook on ai.symfony.com. After adding, removing, or changing any `docs/cookbook/*.rst` file — including the `.. card:` front matter or the `index.rst` toctree order — regenerate the committed website artifacts:
```bash
cd ai.symfony.com && php bin/console app:cookbook:build
```
This rebuilds `ai.symfony.com/config/cookbook.json` and the HTML fragments in `ai.symfony.com/templates/cookbook/content/` from the RST. Always commit the regenerated artifacts together with the RST changes: production (Upsun) ships only the `ai.symfony.com/` directory and cannot run the generator, so stale artifacts would ship outdated cookbook content.

### Development Linking
Use the `./link` script to symlink local development versions:
```bash
# Link components to external project
./link /path/to/project

# Copy instead of symlink
./link --copy /path/to/project

# Rollback changes
./link --rollback /path/to/project
```

### Running Examples
Examples are self-contained and can be run individually:
```bash
cd examples
php anthropic/chat.php
php openai/toolcall.php
```

Many examples require environment variables (see `.env` files in example directories).

### Demo Application
The demo is a full Symfony application:
```bash
cd demo
composer install
symfony server:start
```

## Component Dependencies

Components are designed to work independently but have these relationships:
- Agent depends on Platform for AI communication
- AI Bundle integrates Platform, Agent, and Store
- MCP Bundle provides official MCP SDK integration
- Store is standalone but often used with Agent for RAG applications

## Testing Architecture

Each component uses:
- **PHPUnit 11+** for testing framework
- Component-specific `phpunit.xml.dist` configurations
- Shared fixtures in `/fixtures` for multi-modal content
- MockHttpClient pattern preferred over response mocking

## Development Notes

- Each component in `src/` is a separate Composer package with its own dependencies
- Components follow Symfony coding standards and use `@Symfony` PHP CS Fixer rules
- The monorepo structure allows independent versioning while maintaining shared development workflow
- Do not use void return type for testcase methods
- Always run PHP-CS-Fixer to ensure proper code style
- Always add a newline at the end of the file
- Prefer $this->assert* over self::assert* in tests
- Never add Claude as co-author in the commits
- Add @author tags to newly introduced classes by the user
- Prefer classic if statements over short-circuit evaluation when possible
- Define array shapes for parameters and return types
- Use project specific exceptions instead of global exception classes like \RuntimeException, \InvalidArgumentException etc.
- NEVER mention Claude as co-author in commits
- Avoid using the `empty()` function; prefer explicit checks like `[] === $array`, `'' === $string`, or `null === $value`

## Code Comments

Comments are the exception, not the default. Well-named classes, methods, and variables
should carry the meaning; add a comment only when the code cannot explain itself.

- Comment the *why*, never the *what*: a non-obvious constraint, a provider quirk, a
  workaround for a known upstream bug. Don't narrate what the next line does.
- Describe the implementation as it is, not how it came to be. No references to the
  change, the ticket, the PR, the review, or a previous version ("fix for #123",
  "previously we…", "now also handles…", "as requested") — that context belongs in the
  commit message or PR description.
- Keep comments to a single short line. No multi-line rationale blocks; if a longer
  explanation is needed, it goes into the PR or the docs.
- Don't add PHPDoc that only repeats the native signature; use PHPDoc for what types can't
  express (array shapes, generics, `@throws`, `@author`).
- Be especially restrained in central, frequently read classes (contracts, platform and
  agent core, result/message value objects): every comment there is read by every
  contributor and must keep earning its place.
- When editing existing code, don't add comments to explain your own change, and remove
  comments your change made obsolete.

## Third-Party Bridges

- The `README.md` of every bridge integrating a third-party service must contain a
  `<Provider> Documentation` section linking the provider's relevant docs articles (API
  reference, feature guides the bridge implements), e.g. `src/platform/src/Bridge/Anthropic/README.md`.
  Keep these links in sync when the bridge gains or changes features.
- When working on a bridge, ground the work in the provider's documentation instead of
  assumptions: read the linked articles (and fetch the current version, as provider APIs
  change) before implementing or changing request payloads, parameters, response parsing,
  error handling, or model capabilities. Don't infer one provider's behaviour from another
  provider's API, even if it claims compatibility.

## Documentation vs Cookbook

The content under `docs/` splits into distinct kinds, and confusing them is the most
common authoring mistake. The guiding axis is **orientation**: reference follows the
structure of the *software*; a cookbook recipe follows the structure of the *user's
problem*.

- **Reference / explanation (the component docs)** — describes *what something is*: its
  options, its API, the why behind a design. Organized around the shape of the code.
  The reader jumps in to look up a fact, not to read front-to-back. Truth and
  completeness matter most.
- **Cookbook (`docs/cookbook/`)** — answers *how do I achieve X*. Organized around a
  goal the reader already has, read top-to-bottom toward a concrete working outcome.
  Assumes competence: it solves a real problem, it does not teach the basics.
- **Getting started** — onboarding / learning-oriented walkthroughs belong on the
  **docs index page of the respective component**, not in the cookbook. The cookbook is
  for readers who already know the basics.

When deciding whether a piece belongs in the cookbook, apply these tests:

1. Does it read as a journey to a concrete outcome, or is it something you'd jump into
   the middle of? Journey → cookbook. Lookup → component docs.
2. If you strip the narrative, what's left? If it collapses into "here are the options
   for feature X", it is reference wearing a recipe costume — move it to the docs.
3. Does it compose two or more components/features into a realistic feature
   (e.g. "add memory to a chatbot", "orchestrate multiple agents")? Composition belongs
   in the cookbook; a single-feature walkthrough is usually a doc.
4. A strong recipe should ideally map to something runnable under `examples/`. If there
   is no end artifact you could run to see it work, it is probably explanation/reference.

## Version Documentation

### UPGRADE.md
- Document breaking changes in the root `UPGRADE.md` file
- Format: Use version headers like `UPGRADE FROM 0.X to 0.Y` with sections per component
- Include code examples showing before/after changes with diff syntax
- Every `UPGRADE.md` entry must be paired with the `BC Break` PR label, and adding the `BC Break` label requires a matching `UPGRADE.md` entry in the upcoming (unreleased) section

### CHANGELOG.md
- Each component has its own `CHANGELOG.md` in its root directory
- Add entries for new features, and deprecations under the appropriate version heading
- Format entries as bullet points starting with "Add", "Fix", "Deprecate", etc.
- Bug-fix-only PRs (`Bug fix? = yes`, `New feature? = no`) must not modify any `CHANGELOG.md`/`UPGRADE.md` — unless the fix is itself a BC break, in which case add the `BC Break` label and document it in `UPGRADE.md`
- Only add entries to the upcoming (unreleased) version section; sections already released (version `<=` the latest git tag) are frozen

These conventions are enforced on every PR by `.github/workflows/changelog.yaml`.

### Pull Requests
- Always use the PR template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Fill in the table at the top of the PR description with appropriate values:
  - Bug fix?: yes/no
  - New feature?: yes/no (update CHANGELOG.md files for new features)
  - Docs?: yes/no (required for new features)
  - Issues: Fix #... (prefix each issue number with "Fix #")
  - License: MIT
- Provide a clear description of the changes below the table
