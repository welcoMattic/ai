    I want to build a Symfony app in PHP 8.2 that takes user questions and looks them
    up in a database where they are mapped to answers. If there is close match, it
    retrieves the matched answer. If there isn't, it asks the user to provide an answer
    and stores the question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory
    structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply your reasoning
    at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
