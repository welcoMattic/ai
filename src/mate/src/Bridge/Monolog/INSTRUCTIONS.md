## Monolog Bridge

Use MCP tools instead of CLI for log analysis:

| Instead of...                     | Use                                              |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `tail -f var/log/dev.log`         | `monolog-tail`                                   |
| `grep "error" var/log/*.log`      | `monolog-search` with term "error"               |
| `grep -E "pattern" var/log/*.log` | `monolog-search` with term "pattern", regex: true |

### Benefits

- Structured output with parsed log entries
- Multi-file search across all logs at once
- Filter by environment, level, or channel

### Multi-kernel applications

When several log directories are configured (one per kernel context, e.g. per `APP_ID`), every
entry and file carries a `kernel_context` field, and all tools accept a `kernelContext` parameter
to restrict the lookup to a single kernel.
