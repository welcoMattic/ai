/**
 * Replaces secrets and personal data in a recorded request body.
 *
 * Cassettes are meant to be committed, so whatever a prompt carried at record time ends up in the
 * repository: an address the user typed, a phone number quoted back from a ticket, occasionally an
 * API key pasted into a message by mistake. Sanitizing headers is not enough once the body is
 * stored verbatim.
 *
 * Redaction is therefore on by default rather than opt-in: the failure mode is silent and only
 * surfaces once the cassette is public, which is too late to be a useful signal.
 *
 * Rules come in three tiers, applied in this order:
 *
 *  - credentials are always applied and cannot be switched off;
 *  - personal data is applied by default but can be disabled, because a test may exist precisely to
 *    exercise how personal data flows through a prompt;
 *  - extra patterns cover identifiers that only make sense in one codebase - a customer reference,
 *    an internal ticket format - which no framework default can guess.
 *
 * The order matters: the built-in tiers run first, so a user pattern cannot claim a string a
 * credential rule would have caught.
