/**
 * Blocks until an asynchronous job finishes.
 *
 * This is the only place in the platform that sleeps in a loop. Bridges expose their jobs through a
 * {@see JobClientInterface} and stay free of polling; a caller who does not want to block skips this
 * class entirely and drives {@see JobClientInterface::getStatus()} from a worker or a scheduler.
 *
 * How long the work takes is the provider's knowledge, carried on the handle; how long you are
 * willing to wait for it is yours. State it per call, where the decision usually belongs - the same
 * video job may run for ten minutes in a worker and be given five seconds inside a web request:
 *
 *     $handle = $platform->invoke('MiniMax-Hailuo-02', $prompt)->asJob();
 *
 *     $result = $runner->wait($jobClient, $handle);                    // as long as the job needs
 *     $result = $runner->wait($jobClient, $handle, maxDuration: 5);    // or not a second longer
 *
 * What comes back is a {@see DeferredResult}, the same thing `Platform::invoke()` hands out, so
 * finishing a job reads like any other invocation - `->asFile()`, `->asBinary()`, `->asText()` -
 * instead of leaving the caller to narrow a bare `ResultInterface` itself.
